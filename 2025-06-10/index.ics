SUMMARY:Leipzig\, how are you? - A walk through sensor technology and user
 -generated data
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250610T161000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250610T174000
DESCRIPTION:Sensors are increasingly appearing in Leipzig's cityscape and 
 are needed as a technology for ‘measuring’ urban tasks. In addition to
  sensors\, citizen and user-generated data is an as yet untapped treasure 
 for sustainable urban development. On our walk through Leipzig's city cent
 re\, you will discover where and how sensors and data donations are used i
 n the city and how they are already making our city smarter today (start: 
 New City Hall\, destination: Smart City Lab\, approx. 3\,5km)

SUMMARY:Keeping an eye on urban greenery with satellite data (organized by
  the City of Leipzig)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250610T161000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250610T174000
DESCRIPTION:In the training course\, they learn how they can use satellite
  data to assess the stock of urban greenery and analyse its development. I
 n the UrbanGreenEye project\, Senitel2 data sets were used to create indic
 ators for greenery\, sealing and surface temperature using AI analyses. Th
 e finished indicators are available to all local authorities and intereste
 d citizens as an interactive map on the homepage. It is also possible to u
 se the wms service. The participants of the workshop will learn in a pract
 ical way how the information on the degree of shading\, green volume and s
 ealing can be interpreted and how raster data can be used in the GIS. Exam
 ples will be used to demonstrate the analyses for intersection\, deficit a
 nd change analyses. We also want to give a brief insight into the AI model
 s in order to better understand the data basis. Previous knowledge of GIS 
 is an advantage for participation in the workshop\; having your own GIS ap
 plications on your computer makes it easier to follow up analyses.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250610T123000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250610T140000
DESCRIPTION:Digital participation generates qualitative data in particular
 . Such data is collected by citizens and is therefore often closer to the 
 reality of their own lives and provides information about the local qualit
 y of life. In this workshop\, we will look at what information and data is
  generated in the context of digital participation and how citizen-generat
 ed data can be meaningfully processed and integrated into our urban databa
 se.

 nd discussed in the areas of administrative digitalization and smart city.
  In particular\, the focus will be on how data and (AI) models can be reus
 ed and repurposed in order to develop sustainable solutions in an efficien
 t and resource-saving manner.
