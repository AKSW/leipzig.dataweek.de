SUMMARY:Workshop Agile Kata (organized by Rolf Irion)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T123000
DESCRIPTION:The Agile Kata combines the roots of the agile movement - lean
  in the sense of the Toyota approach - with what constitutes true agility 
 in product development and service delivery.\nInstead of copying another "
 agile" process blueprint onto your team/organisation\, the Agile Kata help
 s you to free yourself from the question of the "right" agile method and m
 ove forward with targeted improvement experiments. From this\, your own ag
 ile process can evolve\, tailored to the needs and goals of your organisat
 ion.\nIf you actively participate in the whole workshop\, we will have cov
 ered enough content from the official AgileKata.Pro curriculum so that you
  can - if you wish - take a test afterwards and gain\ncertification as an 
 Agile Kata Professional (AKP).
