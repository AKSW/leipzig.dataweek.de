## What is Data Week Leipzig?

Data Week is a week-long event in Leipzig focusing on digitization in heterogeneous areas of life as well as transparent, traceable and sustainable applications. For the first time, Data Week Leipzig creates an exchange and networking platform on the topics of data and artificial intelligence at the New City Hall in Leipzig. Through various event formats and keynote presentations, political, scientific and overall social perspectives on these two topics will be presented. Furthermore, the conference program will be complemented by various workshops and a panel discussion. 

The Data Week combines individual event formats in the area of research and transfer (Leipzig Semantic Web Day, DBpedia Symposium, Big Data and AI in Business Workshop), which are organized by the participating scientific and transfer institutions Institute for Applied Informatics and ScaDS.AI Dresden/Leipzig as well as eccenca GmbH, the DBpedia Association and AKSW network.
