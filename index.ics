SUMMARY:Leipzig\, how are you? - A walk through sensor technology and user
 -generated data
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250610T161000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250610T174000
DESCRIPTION:Sensors are increasingly appearing in Leipzig's cityscape and 
 are needed as a technology for ‘measuring’ urban tasks. In addition to
  sensors\, citizen and user-generated data is an as yet untapped treasure 
 for sustainable urban development. On our walk through Leipzig's city cent
 re\, you will discover where and how sensors and data donations are used i
 n the city and how they are already making our city smarter today (start: 
 New City Hall\, destination: Smart City Lab\, approx. 3\,5km)

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T123000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T140000
DESCRIPTION:Test the DoorCE Toolbox for the entire open data lifecycle: In
  this workshop\, participants will learn how to use the Open Data Toolbox\
 , which was developed for managing open data at the municipal level\, to u
 pload\, describe\, license\, and publish data sets without requiring a hig
 h level of technical expertise. The architecture of the toolbox will be pr
 esented\, from modules for data preparation to metadata and license manage
 ment to interfaces (APIs) that enable real-time data usage. Participants c
 an try out the individual steps for themselves using sample data sets from
  the pilot municipalities of the Interreg Central Europe project DoorCE (D
 ata Opener Central Europe)\, preferably with their own laptop. The low-cod
 e/no-code principles of the toolbox are designed to enable even non-techni
 cal employees in administrations and organizations to actively participate
  in shaping open data processes. In addition to practical application\, th
 e organizational and legal framework conditions for data opening will also
  be discussed: What strategies and governance structures are necessary? Ho
 w can cultural change towards open administration be achieved? https://www

SUMMARY:How generative artificial intelligence is changing work and study

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260602T133000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260602T150000
DESCRIPTION:Modern AI-driven chat apps such as ChatGPT\, Gemini\, Claude a
 nd others are changing the way we work unavoidably. For many\, this means 
 writing texts or programming more efficiently. Some people overestimate th
 e quality of generated text and may not admit that they have not curated A
 I-generated text properly. About 20 years ago we had to learn how to “go
 ogle” properly\, today we need to learn how to “prompt”. In this lec
 ture\, we will give an insight into various challenges that the current AI
  revolution is imposing on us and a number of opportunities in this contex
 t. The lecture gives examples\, tips and tricks for dealing with Generativ
 e AI and will be followed by a practical part. It is recommended that you 
 bring your own laptop to take part.

DESCRIPTION:In the EU project GRACE (Growing Climate Resilience in Remote 
 Rural Areas through Community Empowerment)\, European partners are working
  to strengthen the climate resilience of rural regions with the help of fr
 eely accessible data and digital technologies. In this workshop\, particip
 ants will create their own open\, interactive dashboard and learn step by 
 step how to make meaningful use of publicly available map and specialist d
 ata. This includes geodata from OpenStreetMap (OSM) – a global\, collabo
 ratively maintained free map platform – as well as supplementary factual
  information such as climate or population data. We will demonstrate in a 
 practical way how freely available data can be turned into understandable 
 visualizations and why the conscious use of data is more important than th
 e tool used. Using Apache Superset\, participants will gain insights into 
 open-source visualization\, international data use\, and the role of dashb
 oards in climate-resilient\, data-driven decision-making processes.
