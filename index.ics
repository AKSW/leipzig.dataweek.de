DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T123000
DESCRIPTION:The Agile Kata combines the roots of the agile movement - lean
  in the sense of the Toyota approach - with what constitutes true agility 
 in product development and service delivery.\nInstead of copying another "
 agile" process blueprint onto your team/organisation\, the Agile Kata help
 s you to free yourself from the question of the "right" agile method and m
 ove forward with targeted improvement experiments. From this\, your own ag
 ile process can evolve\, tailored to the needs and goals of your organisat
 ion.\nIf you actively participate in the whole workshop\, we will have cov
 ered enough content from the official AgileKata.Pro curriculum so that you
  can - if you wish - take a test afterwards and gain\ncertification as an 
 Agile Kata Professional (AKP).

DESCRIPTION:In the rapidly evolving world of software development\, the in
 tegration of large language models such as GPT4 or WizardCoder into progra
 mming practice has become increasingly essential. The training dives into 
 the world of AI-assisted Python programming and provides comprehensive lea
 rning content aimed at improving participants' programming skills. The mai
 n focus is on using AI tools to improve existing code bases\, simplify com
 plex code to increase readability and maintainability\, and write effectiv
 e test cases that ensure code robustness. In addition\, the training provi
 des insights into increasing code efficiency\, optimizing performance and 
 reducing resource consumption. A significant part is dedicated to debuggin
 g techniques that enable participants to quickly identify and fix code ano
 malies using AI-driven approaches. The training is designed as an interact
 ive and hands-on learning experience and equips participants with the nece
 ssary skills to integrate AI into their programming practices\, resulting 
 in higher quality and efficient software development.
