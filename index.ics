DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T161000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T174000
DESCRIPTION:Sensors are increasingly appearing in Leipzig's cityscape and 
 are needed as a technology for ‘measuring’ urban tasks. In addition to
  sensors\, citizen and user-generated data is an as yet untapped treasure 
 for sustainable urban development. On our walk through Leipzig's city cent
 re\, you will discover where and how sensors and data donations are used i
 n the city and how they are already making our city smarter today (start: 
 New City Hall\, destination: Smart City Lab\, approx. 3\,5km)

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T123000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T140000
DESCRIPTION:Test the DoorCE Toolbox for the entire open data lifecycle: In
  this workshop\, participants will learn how to use the Open Data Toolbox\
 , which was developed for managing open data at the municipal level\, to u
 pload\, describe\, license\, and publish data sets without requiring a hig
 h level of technical expertise. The architecture of the toolbox will be pr
 esented\, from modules for data preparation to metadata and license manage
 ment to interfaces (APIs) that enable real-time data usage. Participants c
 an try out the individual steps for themselves using sample data sets from
  the pilot municipalities of the Interreg Central Europe project DoorCE (D
 ata Opener Central Europe)\, preferably with their own laptop. The low-cod
 e/no-code principles of the toolbox are designed to enable even non-techni
 cal employees in administrations and organizations to actively participate
  in shaping open data processes. In addition to practical application\, th
 e organizational and legal framework conditions for data opening will also
  be discussed: What strategies and governance structures are necessary? Ho
 w can cultural change towards open administration be achieved? https://www

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T143000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T160000
DESCRIPTION:How can we not only demand trust and reliability in the use of
  artificial intelligence\, but also put it into practice? In this session\
 , we bridge the gap between governance principles and the specific challen
 ges of everyday AI operations. The focus is on testing/evaluation and cont
 inuous monitoring. These aspects are more than just technical details. Rat
 her\, they form the basis for responsible and stable AI systems with real 
 added value for your company. We take a practical look at how current meth
 ods and approaches can help to better understand the behavior of AI applic
 ations and identify challenges at an early stage.

 a efficiently to optimize traffic management in cities and rural areas\, m
 inimize CO2 emissions\, and at the same time improve the quality of life f
 or citizens. AIAMO develops and uses AI models to analyze and optimize mob

DESCRIPTION:Modern AI-driven chat apps such as ChatGPT\, Gemini\, Claude a
 nd others are changing the way we work unavoidably. For many\, this means 
 writing texts or programming more efficiently. Some people overestimate th
 e quality of generated text and may not admit that they have not curated A
 I-generated text properly. About 20 years ago we had to learn how to “go
 ogle” properly\, today we need to learn how to “prompt”. In this lec
 ture\, we will give an insight into various challenges that the current AI
  revolution is imposing on us and a number of opportunities in this contex
 t. The lecture gives examples\, tips and tricks for dealing with Generativ
 e AI and will be followed by a practical part. It is recommended that you 
 bring your own laptop to take part.

SUMMARY:AI yesterday\, today\, tomorrow (conducted by the KMI project at I
 nfAI)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260603T090000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260603T103000
DESCRIPTION:The world of AI seems to be moving at breakneck speed. In this
  interactive lecture\, we take a scientific look and draw on personal expe
 rience to examine how AI has developed over the last five years and how pr
 ofound the changes actually are. Which expectations and fears have been re
 alized\, and which technologies are now robust enough for productive use? 
 Where are the limits\, and how do the priorities of research and industry 
 differ? Instead of just asking what AI can do\, we focus on what people ne
 ed. We open up a philosophical space and discuss how AI systems must be de
 signed to support a good life and what visions of the future are already s
 haping our actions today. Together\, we want to develop a realistic and hu
 man-centered perspective on AI. A lecture to think about and discuss.

SUMMARY:KMI Transfer Day - ROOTS Session (conducted by the KMI/ROOTS proje
 ct at InfAI)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260603T090000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260603T103000
DESCRIPTION:Employee participation is a key success factor for successful 
 change processes. This workshop shows how it can be implemented in practic
 e. After an introduction to the theoretical background of participatory ch
 ange processes\, a practical example is used to illustrate how employee pa
 rticipation can contribute to successful organizational design. In the mai
 n part of the workshop\, participants use a participation canvas to work o
 ut how participation can be designed in their own organization. The follow
 ing key questions are addressed:\n\n- Which participation formats are suit
 able for our organizational structure?\n- How can employees be involved an
 d where are the limits of their influence?\n- What prerequisites and resou
 rces are necessary to implement participation?

DESCRIPTION:The workshop presents the browser-based and free platform Bete
 iligung-ROOTS\, which enables digital participation in organizations and a
 ssociations. The focus is on the design of digitally supported participati
 on processes for internal change and transformation projects. Building on 
 theoretical approaches and practical examples in the NPO context\, partici
 pants learn about the functions and possible applications of the platform 
 and test them on site. Finally\, participants will develop their own parti

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260603T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260603T123000
DESCRIPTION:With digitalization\, organizations in a dynamic technological
  environment must adapt their business models and/or value creation proces
 ses. This requires a transformation within organizations\, which should be
  actively shaped through change management. This workshop will discuss the
  barriers to digital transformation on the one hand\, and the pitfalls and
  enabling factors of holistic\, human-centered change management on the ot
 her. The aim of the workshop is to gain a better understanding of how comp
 lex digital change processes can be designed to be sustainable and impleme

 trategy strengthens structures\, processes\, and\, above all\, the people 
 who support these structures. This creates stability and makes organizatio

DESCRIPTION:How can climate data be processed in such a way that it really
  has an impact? In the EU project GRACE (Growing Climate Resilience in Rem
 ote Rural Areas through Community Empowerment)\, European partners are wor
 king to strengthen the climate resilience of rural regions with the help o
 f freely accessible data and digital technologies. In this workshop\, part
 icipants will create their own open\, interactive dashboard and learn step
  by step how to make meaningful use of publicly available maps and special
 ist data. This includes geodata from OpenStreetMap (OSM) – a global\, co
 llaboratively maintained free map platform – as well as supplementary fa
 ctual information such as climate or population data. We will demonstrate 
 in a practical way how freely available data can be turned into understand
 able visualizations and why the conscious use of data is more important th
 an the tool used. Using Apache Superset\, participants gain insights into 
 open-source visualization\, international data use\, and the role of dashb
 oards in climate-resilient\, data-driven decision-making processes. \nPart
 icipants are strongly encouraged to bring their own computers to the works
 hop. The necessary data sets will be provided in advance by the organizers
