SUMMARY:Leipzig\, how are you? - A walk through sensor technology and user
 -generated data
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250610T161000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250610T174000
DESCRIPTION:Sensors are increasingly appearing in Leipzig's cityscape and 
 are needed as a technology for ‘measuring’ urban tasks. In addition to
  sensors\, citizen and user-generated data is an as yet untapped treasure 
 for sustainable urban development. On our walk through Leipzig's city cent
 re\, you will discover where and how sensors and data donations are used i
 n the city and how they are already making our city smarter today (start: 
 New City Hall\, destination: Smart City Lab\, approx. 3\,5km)

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250610T161000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250610T174000
DESCRIPTION:In the training course\, they learn how they can use satellite
  data to assess the stock of urban greenery and analyse its development. I
 n the UrbanGreenEye project\, Senitel2 data sets were used to create indic
 ators for greenery\, sealing and surface temperature using AI analyses. Th
 e finished indicators are available to all local authorities and intereste
 d citizens as an interactive map on the homepage. It is also possible to u
 se the wms service. The participants of the workshop will learn in a pract
 ical way how the information on the degree of shading\, green volume and s
 ealing can be interpreted and how raster data can be used in the GIS. Exam
 ples will be used to demonstrate the analyses for intersection\, deficit a
 nd change analyses. We also want to give a brief insight into the AI model
 s in order to better understand the data basis. Previous knowledge of GIS 
 is an advantage for participation in the workshop\; having your own GIS ap
 plications on your computer makes it easier to follow up analyses.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250611T143000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250611T150000
DESCRIPTION:For electricity to flow reliably from the socket\, the power g
 rid must be in balance at all times: more electricity must never be consum
 ed than generated - and vice versa. However\, this is difficult to predict
 \, especially with wind and solar power. Grid operators have to compensate
  for the fluctuations that occur - this costs money and causes CO₂ emiss
 ions. At Optimax Energy\, we develop models that detect and reduce such im
 balances at an early stage. The particular difficulty is that we do not pr
 edict electricity consumption or production itself\, but rather the errors
  that others make in their forecasts.

DESCRIPTION:This workshop provides a practical demonstration of how AI too
 ls can make everyday work easier. Participants will gain contextual knowle
 dge and the basics of generative AI such as ChatGPT and the use of other f
 reely accessible AI tools. They will also learn about ‘prompting’ tech
 niques to better understand how they work. In the subsequent practical par
 t\, participants can interact with the AI tools and acquire skills that ca

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T123000
DESCRIPTION:Modern AI-driven chat apps such as ChatGPT\, Gemini\, Claude a
 nd others are changing the way we work unavoidably. For many\, this means 
 writing texts or programming more efficiently. Some people overestimate th
 e quality of generated text and may not admit that they have not curated A
 I-generated text properly. About 20 years ago we had to learn how to “go
 ogle” properly\, today we need to learn how to “prompt”. In this lec
 ture\, we will give an insight into various challenges that the current AI
  revolution is imposing on us and a number of opportunities in this contex
 t. The lecture gives examples\, tips and tricks for dealing with Generativ
 e AI and will be followed by a practical part. It is recommended that you 
 bring your own laptop to take part.
