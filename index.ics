DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T120000
DESCRIPTION:The aim of the MoVMi project is to create a transparent data b
 asis for estimating the effectiveness of micrologistics in inner city area
 s. This is made up of existing data\, data from a survey\, synthetically g
 enerated data from a simulation and finally the results of a fusion of the
 se within a logistics simulation\, which has these as input parameters. \n
 Therefore\, a survey was conducted to record the logistics requirements. A
 t the same time\, a simulation is used to generate a movement model for au
 tonomous transport vehicles\, which contains the transport speed depending
  on various application parameters. Finally\, a logistics simulation is cr
 eated based on this\, which can be used to estimate the required number an
 d type of transport systems.

DESCRIPTION:The use of artificial intelligence (AI) can have a variety of 
 effects on corporate communication and relationship culture\, depending la
 rgely on how it is implemented\, used and accepted in an organization. In 
 addition to increased efficiency\, personalization and employee engagement
 \, undesirable consequences based on mistrust\, uncertainty\, distance or 
 resistance can also be expected. \nThe presentation discusses possible con
 sequences of AI-initiated change processes and suggests ways of conscious 
 handling and open communication in order to promote the positive effects a

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T100000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T103000
DESCRIPTION:The opening keynote will challenge the apparent opposition bet
 ween AI and sustainability and show how these two areas can go hand in han
 d. Under the motto "Green Data\, Green Future: Can AI Save Us?"\, it will 
 shed light on what AI and sustainability have in common: Both require a re
 liable data basis. But how can this data be provided and what needs to be 
 considered when AI is used for sustainability? The thesis of the keynote: 
 Linking data\, AI and sustainability opens up a wide range of opportunitie
 s to jointly shape a future worth living in and make a positive contributi
 on to environmental protection. Because as the motto "Connecting people - 
 using data" of the Data Week promises\, it is people who make the differen
 ce. The audience of this keynote will learn examples of what it can look l
 ike to take on responsibility in the digital world!

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T123000
DESCRIPTION:Citizen participation thrives on self-organized bottom-up proc
 esses. To this end\, it is important to bring the actors together in analo
 g form\; however\, it is equally important to provide digital tools in adv
 ance and afterwards so that processes and contacts are maintained and the 
 'drive' is maintained. This is where collaborative networks can help bring
  stakeholders together in advance based on their interests and support the
  process from idea to implementation.\nAs a collaborative network\, dream 
 machine is working on the implementation of our vision for self-organized 
 bottom-up participation processes and the development of networks for proj
 ects that have a direct impact on those involved.\nIn this keynote\, dream
  machine will present the current state of the platform\, its relation to 
 participation processes and its vision for self-organized processes in bot
 h analogue and digital space. The lecture is aimed at all those who are ac
 tively involved in participation processes\, as well as those who want to 
 jointly implement projects from idea to completion and get to know interes
 ting and diverse people in the process.\nAfterwards\, dream machine invite
 s you to a collaborative workshop in which problems\, requirements and vis
 ions for participation processes of the future can be developed and what r
 ole digital tools can play in this process

 e.  \n\nThe challenge: The screens for news and events are to be conceptua
 lly adapted in terms of usability\, aesthetics\, memorability and accessib
 ility. It is important to develop an appealing design that leaves a positi
 ve overall impression. In addition\, a template is to be designed for a th
 eme page that is only activated for special events and is easily accessibl
 e. The structure will be fixed\, with only the information changing depend
 ing on the event. The page is designed to present all relevant information
  in an appealing and clear way. A collaborative web application for collab
 oration\, brainstorming and design will be provided as part of the hackath

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T133000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T140000
DESCRIPTION:Thermal bridges are weak points in the building envelope that 
 can lead to energy losses\, moisture accumulation and mold growth in the b
 uilding fabric. Drones with thermographic cameras can be used to detect th
 ermal bridges in large building stocks. To this end\, we have created a fr
 eely available data set comprising 926 high-resolution 5-channel images (R
 GB\, thermal and height) with 6\,927 annotations and cataloged according t
 o FAIR principles. Using deep learning\, we also automatically analyzed th
 is extensive set of panoramic image data of the Karlsruhe roofs and segmen
 ted thermal bridges. In our experiments\, we use current neural model arch
 itectures: MaskRCNN R18\, MaskRCNN R50\, Swin-T Transformer\, TridentNet\,
  FSAF with and without pre-training. During training\, we also determined 
 the electrical energy required for the learning process.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T140000

DESCRIPTION:In our latitudes\, there is a regular demand for heating energ
 y in buildings in winter and an increasing demand for cooling energy in su
 mmer due to climate change. It therefore makes sense to aim for a seasonal
  shift in regenerative heating and cooling by tapping into large storage m
 asses\, for which the use of the ground by means of near-surface geotherma
 l energy is predestined.  Near-surface geothermal energy offers a whole ra
 nge of different technologies\, e.g. flat collectors\, energy baskets or b
 orehole fields\, as well as agrothermal\, river and tunnel thermal energy\
 , and enables a sustainable supply of heating and cooling from sources ava

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T163000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T170000
DESCRIPTION:For some years now\, the systematic handling of digital inform
 ation and the development of associated data infrastructures has played a 
 role in almost all local authorities. However\, despite similar challenges
 \, all too often they set out on their own. Yet it is precisely the collab
 orative interaction of many municipalities that creates innovative strengt
 h and synergy effects.\nIn order to provide a decisive building block of t
 his urban data infrastructure in the long term\, a community of 12 cities 
 and municipal utilities has joined forces within the Civitas Connect assoc
 iation to jointly define the core of an urban data platform called "CIVITA
 S/CORE". In doing so\, they exchange experiences and their requirements fo
 r the provision of data for a wide range of smart city use cases in order 
 to design a generic platform. Development started in January 2024.\nMunici
 palities should address the issue of value creation at an early stage when
  considering the data platform - only if it is possible to cover a large n
 umber of relevant use cases in the municipal environment and manage the as
 sociated data sets with confidence will value-adding and therefore sustain
 able data infrastructures emerge as the core of digital services of genera

DESCRIPTION:The participation of citizens in local development projects is
  becoming increasingly important\, but it is also a major challenge. Often
 \, only the well-known "bubble" of committed stakeholders is reached\, des
 pite a great deal of time and financial investment. In addition\, the tran
 sparent presentation and communication of different phases and results in 
 participation processes is sometimes difficult.\nThe internet makes it pos
 sible to involve people intensively and regularly. There are digital solut
 ions for citizen surveys\, ideas competitions and even active involvement 
 in urban planning processes. And many municipalities are already using dig
 ital participation tools (e.g. Adhocracy\, Consul\, Dipas\, Wechange\, etc
 .). However\, the individual applications only ever cover part of the func
 tions required by a municipality. At the same time\, the introduction and 
 parallel use of several tools with different interfaces can easily overwhe
 lm users.\nThe smart cities/regions of Bamberg\, Hildesheim\, Lübeck and 
 the KielRegion are tackling this challenge and want to develop joint solut
 ions for tailor-made tools that are easier to integrate and connect. These
  are to be collected and made available in a participation toolbox that ca
 n be accessed by all German municipalities.

 panion with the help of an urban data platform as a hub for urban data (ap
 prox. 30 min.).\nFollowing this\, practical use cases will be developed in
  a workshop with and for the participants. The aim is to experience the me
 thodical approach in practice\, as well as "thinking outside the box" when
  it comes to the creative process of developing city-specific functions (a

 t were the biggest obstacles for the funding recipients and how could they
  be solved? The SDDI guidelines were evaluated on the basis of practical f
 indings and adapted by DKSR after the end of the project. The status quo o
 f the practical guide will be presented and discussed in the workshop. In 
 the second part of the workshops\, we would also like to record the implem

SUMMARY:Municipal data works: data sharing within a legally secure framewo
 rk
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T133000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T150000
DESCRIPTION:The exchange of sensitive\, sometimes restrictive data from va
 rious areas such as transport\, environmental protection and social servic
 es holds great potential for efficient digital services of general interes
 t. At the same time\, this exchange raises new requirements for a legally 
 secure space that can strengthen cooperation between stakeholders and map 
 diverse access rights. The "Kommunale Datenwerke" (KDW) project addresses 
 this gap by developing a data sharing platform for the intra- and inter-mu
 nicipal exchange of static and dynamic data. It demonstrates how the neces
 sary framework for sharing data with different access rights and different
  types and formats can be created with the help of a user-friendly interfa
 ce and the associated role and rights model.\nThis keynote speech will pro
 vide an insight into the functions and technologies of the KDW and the sta
 tus of the pilot project\, which is being realized together with Mainzer S
 tadtwerke AG. Afterwards\, there will be room for questions on the topic o
 f (municipal) data exchange.\n[https://bmdv.bund.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/

 s\, supermarkets or green spaces or the quality of public transport in the
  various cities and regions in Germany? For these and many other questions
 \, GOAT can be tested collaboratively in the workshop in interaction with 
 the integrated data in small groups for any area. The results should provi

DESCRIPTION:FLOOD.Bi is a WebGIS tool on the subject of flooding and damag
 e reduction to buildings. It provides a comprehensive overview of property
 -related hazards\, potential damage and risks as well as the effect of pre
 ventive measures. It is primarily aimed at building owners\, specialist pl
 anners and engineering offices in order to make an initial assessment of t
 he affected buildings and to support the selection and implementation of p
 reventive measures. In conjunction with a concrete structural survey on si
 te\, engineering planning and professional implementation\, the majority o
 f flood damage can be effectively reduced or avoided.\nThe tool is based o
 n the engineering model approach developed by the IOER\, which identifies 
 potential flood damage on the basis of building types. The special feature
  of this tool is the linking of the type-based approach with individual in
 formation on building construction and building services\, so that concret
 e proposals for damage reduction measures can be developed.\nThe tool can 
 be accessed via the data portal of the Saxon State Office for the Environm
 ent\, Agriculture and Geology. It is available throughout Saxony and for t
 he Czech districts of Karlovy Vary\, Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.\nhttps:

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T103000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T120000
DESCRIPTION:This training introduces the enhancement of Knowledge Graphs (
 KG) with Large Language Models (LLM) and Graph Machine Learning (GML) in t
 he context of Semantic Web Technologies (SWT). The Knowledge Graph\, a cru
 cial component of the Semantic Web\, holds substantial potential for trans
 forming various industries\, despite facing challenges like integration di
 fficulties and its requirement for developers with specialized expertise. 
 On the other hand\, Large Language Models\, though showing promise\, encou
 nter uncertainties such as hallucination in outputs and high operational c
 osts. The training emphasises a synergistic approach\, showcasing how LLMs
  and GML contribute to KG construction\, addressing issues like data clean
 ing and relation extraction. The focus is on utilising open-source technol
 ogies for KG construction\, aiming to assist industries in harnessing the 
 benefits of this technology. The targeted audience includes individuals or
  groups interested in digitisation with minimal prior knowledge of KGs\, p
 roviding them with a streamlined workflow for proof of concept within thei
 r organisations. The training materials will be accessible via a GitHub re
 pository\, and feedback sessions will be provided to address general quest
 ions. Specific or in-depth inquiries will receive dedicated support post-t
 raining\, particularly if the number of participants exceeds 15.
