DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250610T161000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250610T174000
DESCRIPTION:Sensors are increasingly appearing in Leipzig's cityscape and 
 are needed as a technology for ‘measuring’ urban tasks. In addition to
  sensors\, citizen and user-generated data is an as yet untapped treasure 
 for sustainable urban development. On our walk through Leipzig's city cent
 re\, you will discover where and how sensors and data donations are used i
 n the city and how they are already making our city smarter today (start: 
 New City Hall\, destination: Smart City Lab\, approx. 3\,5km)

DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250610T174000
DESCRIPTION:In the training course\, they learn how they can use satellite
  data to assess the stock of urban greenery and analyse its development. I
 n the UrbanGreenEye project\, Senitel2 data sets were used to create indic
 ators for greenery\, sealing and surface temperature using AI analyses. Th
 e finished indicators are available to all local authorities and intereste
 d citizens as an interactive map on the homepage. It is also possible to u
 se the wms service. The participants of the workshop will learn in a pract
 ical way how the information on the degree of shading\, green volume and s
 ealing can be interpreted and how raster data can be used in the GIS. Exam
 ples will be used to demonstrate the analyses for intersection\, deficit a
 nd change analyses. We also want to give a brief insight into the AI model
 s in order to better understand the data basis. Previous knowledge of GIS 
 is an advantage for participation in the workshop\; having your own GIS ap
 plications on your computer makes it easier to follow up analyses.

DESCRIPTION:We live in a time in which many areas of our environment are c
 ontinuously monitored by new sensors - on land\, in the air and in the wat
 er. This generates huge amounts of data that make it possible to record en
 vironmental changes and the state of ecosystems almost in real time. At th
 e same time\, however\, there are major data gaps. Contrary to expectation
 s\, reliable information on key environmental parameters such as biodivers
 ity\, tree health\, tree mortality or water quality is often difficult to 
 access. How can we close these gaps? Artificial intelligence (AI) methods 
 offer new approaches to supplement missing knowledge. By training AI model
 s with selectively collected ground measurements and widely available sate
 llite data\, they learn to recognize common patterns. This allows us to ga
 in new insights into the state of our environment. In this talk\, I will s
 how how we at Leipzig University use AI methods to make previously hidden 
 transformations in our ecosystems visible and our data interactive.

 mes
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250611T133000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250611T135000
DESCRIPTION:Energy drives machines. But energy actually drives everything 
 in our world\, including the people of Stanz im Mürztal. They took their 
 energy future into their own hands 10 years ago and have become a little m
 ore independent and self-determined from the energy drip of the big world 
 with clever technology\, communication and courageous citizens. Friedrich 
 Pichler\, the former mayor of Stanz im Mürztal\, a small rural community 
 in Styria/Austria\, tells you what all this has to do with a sociologist\,
  token engineering and an alert village community.

DESCRIPTION:What happens when energy is more than just a kilowatt hour? In
  renewable energy communities\, surplus energy suddenly becomes a social a
 nd economic good. Tokenization makes it shareable\, tradable - and traceab

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250611T143000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250611T150000
DESCRIPTION:For electricity to flow reliably from the socket\, the power g
 rid must be in balance at all times: more electricity must never be consum
 ed than generated - and vice versa. However\, this is difficult to predict
 \, especially with wind and solar power. Grid operators have to compensate
  for the fluctuations that occur - this costs money and causes CO₂ emiss
 ions. At Optimax Energy\, we develop models that detect and reduce such im
 balances at an early stage. The particular difficulty is that we do not pr
 edict electricity consumption or production itself\, but rather the errors
  that others make in their forecasts.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T091000

DESCRIPTION:Cloud-native software products consist of individually lifecyc
 led\, frequently released\, and flexibly assembled components known as "mi
 croservices".\n\nThe Keynote presentation will be an exploration of how te
 chnical documentation for such products can be automated. The challenge fo
 r automation is that content must be lifecycled per microservice\, but pre
 sented from the perspective of the product user\, who "sees" features and 
 use cases instead of microservices.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T123000
DESCRIPTION:Modern AI-driven chat apps such as ChatGPT\, Gemini\, Claude a
 nd others are changing the way we work unavoidably. For many\, this means 
 writing texts or programming more efficiently. Some people overestimate th
 e quality of generated text and may not admit that they have not curated A
 I-generated text properly. About 20 years ago we had to learn how to “go
 ogle” properly\, today we need to learn how to “prompt”. In this lec
 ture\, we will give an insight into various challenges that the current AI
  revolution is imposing on us and a number of opportunities in this contex
 t. The lecture gives examples\, tips and tricks for dealing with Generativ
 e AI and will be followed by a practical part. It is recommended that you 
 bring your own laptop to take part.

  modern work processes. Through practical exercises with LEGO® SERIOUS PL
 AY®\, participants visualize different aspects and use cases of AI. Build
 ing models makes it possible to concretize ideas and gain new perspectives
  on the opportunities and challenges of AI integration. This session offer
 s the opportunity to reflect on the AI maturity level of your own organiza
 tion\, identify skills gaps and develop future-oriented visions for AI tra
 nsformation. Whether you are new to AI or experienced\, everyone can gain 
 valuable insights and benefit from sharing experiences.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T153000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T170000
DESCRIPTION:The workshop aims to highlight parallels between the moon land
 ing and digital transformation: Both scenarios require navigating uncharte
 d territory\, where there are no clear blueprints and quick\, informed dec
 isions in teams are required. Just as astronauts on the moon had to deal w
 ith limited resources and unpredictable risks\, project teams in digitaliz
 ation and AI projects are faced with the challenge of developing innovativ
 e solutions and reacting flexibly to new information. Through collaborativ
 e prioritization and decision-making in the NASA Moon Survival game\, part
 icipants experience first-hand the importance of effective communication\,
  teamwork and strategic decision-making. They learn how to manage uncertai
 nty and develop creative solutions to problems - skills that are crucial i
 n the digital transformation.

 ramming languages and digital design. As an additional input\, we will pre
 sent the soil moisture sensor technology of the city of\nLeipzig\, which w
 ill be used to monitor city and park trees in real time.\n\nThe event is a

 or prior knowledge required. All tools and materials will be provided\, bu
 t you are welcome to bring your own laptops or tablets. We use free softwa
