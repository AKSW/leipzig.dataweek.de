 are looking for solutions. In some cases\, this is being done jointly in i
 nternational networks. In this panel\, we will discuss with experts from p

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T100000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T103000
DESCRIPTION:The opening keynote will challenge the apparent opposition bet
 ween AI and sustainability and show how these two areas can go hand in han
 d. Under the motto "Green Data\, Green Future: Can AI Save Us?"\, it will 
 shed light on what AI and sustainability have in common: Both require a re
 liable data basis. But how can this data be provided and what needs to be 
 considered when AI is used for sustainability? The thesis of the keynote: 
 Linking data\, AI and sustainability opens up a wide range of opportunitie
 s to jointly shape a future worth living in and make a positive contributi
 on to environmental protection. Because as the motto "Connecting people - 
 using data" of the Data Week promises\, it is people who make the differen
 ce. The audience of this keynote will learn examples of what it can look l
 ike to take on responsibility in the digital world!

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T133000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T140000
DESCRIPTION:Thermal bridges are weak points in the building envelope that 
 can lead to energy losses\, moisture accumulation and mold growth in the b
 uilding fabric. Drones with thermographic cameras can be used to detect th
 ermal bridges in large building stocks. To this end\, we have created a fr
 eely available data set comprising 926 high-resolution 5-channel images (R
 GB\, thermal and height) with 6\,927 annotations and cataloged according t
 o FAIR principles. Using deep learning\, we also automatically analyzed th
 is extensive set of panoramic image data of the Karlsruhe roofs and segmen
 ted thermal bridges. In our experiments\, we use current neural model arch
 itectures: MaskRCNN R18\, MaskRCNN R50\, Swin-T Transformer\, TridentNet\,
  FSAF with and without pre-training. During training\, we also determined 
 the electrical energy required for the learning process.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T140000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T143000
DESCRIPTION:In our latitudes\, there is a regular demand for heating energ
 y in buildings in winter and an increasing demand for cooling energy in su
 mmer due to climate change. It therefore makes sense to aim for a seasonal
  shift in regenerative heating and cooling by tapping into large storage m
 asses\, for which the use of the ground by means of near-surface geotherma
 l energy is predestined.  Near-surface geothermal energy offers a whole ra
 nge of different technologies\, e.g. flat collectors\, energy baskets or b
 orehole fields\, as well as agrothermal\, river and tunnel thermal energy\
 , and enables a sustainable supply of heating and cooling from sources ava
 ilable on site or in the immediate vicinity.

DESCRIPTION:Time series predictions are a central part of optimizing moder

 orecasting\, classical models are still serious competitors\, especially w
 hen computational complexity and resource consumption are relevant.\nUsing
  the ReCycle framework\, we show how a good understanding of the advantage
 s and disadvantages of both approaches can improve interpretability\, effi
 ciency and precision. The result is AI models that can be trained on a sta
 ndard laptop and can keep up with or even surpass the state of the art.

 as well as the participating environment\, in order to achieve relevant an

 in such a way that they are empowered to build their own urban digital twi
 ns. After all\, what knowledge is actually relevant and what do other citi
 es need? We are therefore interested in exchanging ideas with other cities
  in order to find out what common ideas and solutions already exist for kn
 owledge transfer and the transferability of solutions.

 eld of urban development. In the interaction between government\, research
 \, industry and citizens\, ways of implementing the concept of a more live

 can be demonstrated. The Toolbox Datenkompetenz (TBDK\, https://beta.toolb

 th data and offers a Jupyter notebook environment for individual processin
 g of data projects. In order to work with the data\, it is recommended to 
 bring a laptop. However\, participation in the training will also be possi

SUMMARY:Empowering Knowledge Graphs with AI (organized by brox-IT Solution

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T103000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T120000
DESCRIPTION:This training introduces the enhancement of Knowledge Graphs (
 KG) with Large Language Models (LLM) and Graph Machine Learning (GML) in t
 he context of Semantic Web Technologies (SWT). The Knowledge Graph\, a cru
 cial component of the Semantic Web\, holds substantial potential for trans
 forming various industries\, despite facing challenges like integration di
 fficulties and its requirement for developers with specialized expertise. 
 On the other hand\, Large Language Models\, though showing promise\, encou
 nter uncertainties such as hallucination in outputs and high operational c
 osts. The training emphasises a synergistic approach\, showcasing how LLMs
  and GML contribute to KG construction\, addressing issues like data clean
 ing and relation extraction. The focus is on utilising open-source technol
 ogies for KG construction\, aiming to assist industries in harnessing the 
 benefits of this technology. The targeted audience includes individuals or
  groups interested in digitisation with minimal prior knowledge of KGs\, p
 roviding them with a streamlined workflow for proof of concept within thei
 r organisations. The training materials will be accessible via a GitHub re
 pository\, and feedback sessions will be provided to address general quest
 ions. Specific or in-depth inquiries will receive dedicated support post-t
 raining\, particularly if the number of participants exceeds 15.
