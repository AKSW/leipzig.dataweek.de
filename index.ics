SUMMARY:Agile Kata workshop - more business agility with fewer blueprints 
 (organized by Rolf Irion)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T123000
DESCRIPTION:Agile initiatives often come to a standstill at an initial pla
 teau of improvement and then get bogged down in discussions about what is 
 methodologically right\, wrong\, allowed or forbidden. \nAgile Kata combin
 es "lean"\, the root of the agile movement\, with what constitutes true ag
 ility. Agile Kata helps to free oneself from the question of the "right" a
 gile method and to move forward with targeted improvement experiments inst
 ead of copying another "agile" blueprint. This can even lead to the develo
 pment of your own agile approach\, tailored to the needs and goals of your
  organisation. \nIf you actively participate in the entire workshop\, you 
 have the option of attending an online follow-up session of approx. 2 hour
 s - at no additional cost - to cover the remaining content of the official
  AgileKata.Pro curriculum and subsequently obtain certification as an Agil

SUMMARY:Toolbox Datenkompetenz - Training Designing a city with data - Sma

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T123000
DESCRIPTION:The term Smart City\, understood in the sense of an innovative
 \, technology-driven development concept of the urban space\, is primarily
  based on the beneficial\, secure handling of data by all involved actors.
  With the Smart City training\, we want to invite the participants to go t
 hrough the data cycle together using an example with open data from the fi
 eld of urban development. In the interaction between government\, research
 \, industry and citizens\, ways of implementing the concept of a more live
 able\, progressive\, ecological and socially inclusive\, data-driven city 
 can be demonstrated. The Toolbox Datenkompetenz (TBDK\, https://beta.toolb
 oxdatenkompetenz.de/) is a platform for learning all aspects of working wi
 th data and offers a Jupyter notebook environment for individual processin
 g of data projects. In order to work with the data\, it is recommended to 
 bring a laptop. However\, participation in the training will also be possi
 ble without your own laptop. Prior knowledge in the areas addressed in the
  training is beneficial\, but not required.

 s) 
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T103000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T120000
DESCRIPTION:This training introduces the enhancement of Knowledge Graphs (
 KG) with Large Language Models (LLM) and Graph Machine Learning (GML) in t
 he context of Semantic Web Technologies (SWT). The Knowledge Graph\, a cru
 cial component of the Semantic Web\, holds substantial potential for trans
 forming various industries\, despite facing challenges like integration di
 fficulties and its requirement for developers with specialized expertise. 
 On the other hand\, Large Language Models\, though showing promise\, encou
 nter uncertainties such as hallucination in outputs and high operational c
 osts. The training emphasises a synergistic approach\, showcasing how LLMs
  and GML contribute to KG construction\, addressing issues like data clean
 ing and relation extraction. The focus is on utilising open-source technol
 ogies for KG construction\, aiming to assist industries in harnessing the 
 benefits of this technology. The targeted audience includes individuals or
  groups interested in digitisation with minimal prior knowledge of KGs\, p
 roviding them with a streamlined workflow for proof of concept within thei
 r organisations. The training materials will be accessible via a GitHub re
 pository\, and feedback sessions will be provided to address general quest
 ions. Specific or in-depth inquiries will receive dedicated support post-t
 raining\, particularly if the number of participants exceeds 15.
