DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T161000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T174000
DESCRIPTION:Sensors are increasingly appearing in Leipzig's cityscape and 
 are needed as a technology for ‘measuring’ urban tasks. In addition to
  sensors\, citizen and user-generated data is an as yet untapped treasure 
 for sustainable urban development. On our walk through Leipzig's city cent
 re\, you will discover where and how sensors and data donations are used i
 n the city and how they are already making our city smarter today (start: 
 New City Hall\, destination: Smart City Lab\, approx. 3\,5km)

SUMMARY:AI-ready data – the foundation for real AI success
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T133000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T140000
DESCRIPTION:AI-ready data forms the indispensable basis for successful AI 
 initiatives\, as unclear data quality and a lack of transparency are among
  the most common reasons for project failure. A structured 360° view of t
 he data landscape reveals existing data treasures\, enables realistic use 
 case evaluations\, and provides clarity about potential and gaps. The FAIR
  criteria serve as a framework for sustainable and high-performance data q
 uality. By focusing on data maturity measures\, which range from data inve
 ntory and maturity assessment to the derivation of concrete measures\, the
  path to a robust database is systematically outlined. Supplemented by pra
 ctical experience and lessons learned\, we show how companies can optimize
  their data landscape in a targeted manner and thus ensure the future viab
 ility of data-driven AI projects.

SUMMARY:Tomorrow's archiving – the data lifecycle in public administrati
 on
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T143000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T150000
DESCRIPTION:Public administration files and information go through a compl
 ex life cycle that is regulated by law from data creation to deletion or a
 rchiving and has been practiced for many years. But how do the legal requi
 rements that form the basis of the digital life cycle translate to digital
  administration? In this context\, the goal of electronic archiving is alw
 ays to generate open data. During the event\, which will feature a fluid t
 ransition between lectures and workshops\, the current status and developm
 ent goals will be clearly illustrated using the example of Leipzig's city 
 administration. The presentation will also explicitly address limiting fac
 tors such as legal requirements\, capacities\, interface developments\, an
 d expectations. The event will conclude with an interdisciplinary and open
 -ended discussion about prospects\, expectations\, and visions for the fut

 ng context
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T150000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T153000
DESCRIPTION:Handwritten texts are not only found in historical archives\, 
 but also in modern industrial everyday life—for example\, on labels\, fo
 rms\, or protocols. However\, their automatic recognition poses particular
  challenges for data science\, especially in German-speaking countries\, w
 here freely available\, diverse handwriting datasets are rare. In this pre
 sentation\, we introduce two new\, publicly accessible datasets created fr
 om 852 handwritten German pages. Both datasets have been published on Zeno
 do and are freely available to researchers in linguistics\, computer scien
 ce\, and related disciplines.\nThe presentation shows how OCR models can b
 e successfully transferred to real-world applications. The contribution co
 mbines open data\, modern AI methods\, and concrete industrial use cases
 —and shows how handwriting recognition can advance both research and pra
 ctice today.

DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T140000
DESCRIPTION:Test the DoorCE Toolbox for the entire open data lifecycle: In
  this workshop\, participants will learn how to use the Open Data Toolbox\
 , which was developed for managing open data at the municipal level\, to u
 pload\, describe\, license\, and publish data sets without requiring a hig
 h level of technical expertise. The architecture of the toolbox will be pr
 esented\, from modules for data preparation to metadata and license manage
 ment to interfaces (APIs) that enable real-time data usage. Participants c
 an try out the individual steps for themselves using sample data sets from
  the pilot municipalities of the Interreg Central Europe project DoorCE (D
 ata Opener Central Europe)\, preferably with their own laptop. The low-cod
 e/no-code principles of the toolbox are designed to enable even non-techni
 cal employees in administrations and organizations to actively participate
  in shaping open data processes. In addition to practical application\, th
 e organizational and legal framework conditions for data opening will also
  be discussed: What strategies and governance structures are necessary? Ho
 w can cultural change towards open administration be achieved? https://www

 ges of everyday AI operations. The focus is on testing/evaluation and cont
 inuous monitoring. These aspects are more than just technical details. Rat
 her\, they form the basis for responsible and stable AI systems with real 
 added value for your company. We take a practical look at how current meth
 ods and approaches can help to better understand the behavior of AI applic
 ations and identify challenges at an early stage.

  artificial intelligence (AI) with concrete\, practical applications in th
 e field of intermodal and multimodal mobility. It aims to use mobility dat
 a efficiently to optimize traffic management in cities and rural areas\, m
 inimize CO2 emissions\, and at the same time improve the quality of life f
 or citizens. AIAMO develops and uses AI models to analyze and optimize mob
 ility data. By integrating previously unused data and intelligently networ
 king and analyzing it\, new opportunities for sustainable mobility are ope

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260602T133000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260602T150000
DESCRIPTION:Modern AI-driven chat apps such as ChatGPT\, Gemini\, Claude a
 nd others are changing the way we work unavoidably. For many\, this means 
 writing texts or programming more efficiently. Some people overestimate th
 e quality of generated text and may not admit that they have not curated A
 I-generated text properly. About 20 years ago we had to learn how to “go
 ogle” properly\, today we need to learn how to “prompt”. In this lec
 ture\, we will give an insight into various challenges that the current AI
  revolution is imposing on us and a number of opportunities in this contex
 t. The lecture gives examples\, tips and tricks for dealing with Generativ
 e AI and will be followed by a practical part. It is recommended that you 
 bring your own laptop to take part.

DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260603T103000
DESCRIPTION:The world of AI seems to be moving at breakneck speed. In this
  interactive lecture\, we take a scientific look and draw on personal expe
 rience to examine how AI has developed over the last five years and how pr
 ofound the changes actually are. Which expectations and fears have been re
 alized\, and which technologies are now robust enough for productive use? 
 Where are the limits\, and how do the priorities of research and industry 
 differ? Instead of just asking what AI can do\, we focus on what people ne
 ed. We open up a philosophical space and discuss how AI systems must be de
 signed to support a good life and what visions of the future are already s
 haping our actions today. Together\, we want to develop a realistic and hu
 man-centered perspective on AI. A lecture to think about and discuss.

DESCRIPTION:Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer a topic for the futu

 But while companies and public authorities are increasingly using AI techn
 ologies\, civil society often lags behind. Is it too complex\, too uncerta
 in\, too many unanswered questions? Or is it a missed opportunity for grea
 ter public welfare\, participation\, and innovation?\nAI offers enormous p
 otential for civil society action\, from the automation of processes to da
 ta-based campaigns and new forms of participation. At the same time\, pres
 sing questions arise: How can data protection and ethics be guaranteed? Wh
 ere are the limits and risks? And how can AI be designed in such a way tha
 t it truly serves the common good?\nIn this discussion\, we want to highli
 ght specific examples\, challenges\, and solutions and discuss together ho
 w civil society can use AI responsibly and courageously.

 f freely accessible data and digital technologies. In this workshop\, part
 icipants will create their own open\, interactive dashboard and learn step
  by step how to make meaningful use of publicly available maps and special
 ist data. This includes geodata from OpenStreetMap (OSM) – a global\, co
 llaboratively maintained free map platform – as well as supplementary fa
 ctual information such as climate or population data. We will demonstrate 
 in a practical way how freely available data can be turned into understand
 able visualizations and why the conscious use of data is more important th
 an the tool used. Using Apache Superset\, participants gain insights into 
 open-source visualization\, international data use\, and the role of dashb
 oards in climate-resilient\, data-driven decision-making processes. \nPart
