DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T103000
DESCRIPTION:Get ready to push the boundaries of industrial automation! Wit
 h our Global Thingkathon\, we’re taking co-innovation to the next level.
  At various locations around the globe\, we’ll simultaneously test and v
 alidate real-world use cases on the Smart Systems Hub’s Manufacturing-X 
 Testbed. Together with our international network of partners\, we aim to e
 xplore feasibility\, identify potential\, and bring groundbreaking solutio
 ns to life. Join us on this journey to shape the future of manufacturing! 
 The Challenge: How can we create an open and interconnected platform for t
 he industry and how can we make use of the data collected and shared? This
  Thin[gk]athon\, which is organized by the Smart Systms Hub\, is meant to 
 provide an opportunity to explore the possibilites of shared Data in the c
 ontext of Manufacturing-X. What can it be used for and how can we implemen
 t possible solutions? More information: https://www.smart-systems-hub.de/d

SUMMARY:LSWT Keynote: Using Knowledge Graphs to Document Cloud Native Prod
 ucts
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T091000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T103000
DESCRIPTION:Cloud-native software products consist of individually lifecyc
 led\, frequently released\, and flexibly assembled components known as "mi
 croservices". The Key Note presentation will be an exploration of how tech
 nical documentation for such products can be automated. The challenge for 
 automation is that content must be lifecycled per microservice\, but prese
 nted from the perspective of the product user\, who "sees" features and us
 e cases instead of microservices.\nMartin Blumbach (www.ericsson.com/de) t
 ogether with Marcel Fröhlich (www.eccenca.com) will present the Ericsson 
 content delivery pipeline built around a “knowledge graph platform” ba
 sed on eccenca corporate memory. Knowledge is expressed in RDF knowledge g
 raphs that are automatically instantiated from machine-readable informatio
 n “fragments” and manually created DITA topics. DITA bookmaps containi
 ng manually and automatically created DITA topics are automatically assemb
 led for publication. They also present knowledge visualization for SMEs an
 d give an outlook on how knowledge can be repurposed\, for example for gen
 erative AI.\n

SUMMARY:How generative artificial intelligence is changing work and study(
 organized by ScaDS.AI)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T123000
DESCRIPTION:Modern AI-driven chat apps such as ChatGPT\, Gemini\, Claude a
 nd others are changing the way we work unavoidably. For many\, this means 
 writing texts or programming more efficiently. Some people overestimate th
 e quality of generated text and may not admit that they have not curated A
 I-generated text properly. About 20 years ago we had to learn how to “go
 ogle” properly\, today we need to learn how to “prompt”. In this lec
 ture\, we will give an insight into various challenges that the current AI
  revolution is imposing on us and a number of opportunities in this contex
 t. The lecture gives examples\, tips and tricks for dealing with Generativ
 e AI and will be followed by a practical part. It is recommended that you 
 bring your own laptop to take part.

 lore the potential that digital methods and processes can offer. We will s
 hare best practice examples with other local authorities. We will summaris
