Program

Users of Big Data-technologies and AI in business and research will be given the opportunity to talk about their practical insights as well as challenges. We invite you to actively join the discussion and take part at BDIB 2022.
BDIB aims to foster the transfer of research results in the areas Big Data, Data Science and AI into business applications. Furthermore we want to improve the practical and professional exchange of information between application partners and stakeholders in the Big Data and AI industry. Speakers of regionally and internationally operating organisations will present their practical experiences regarding new methods in Data Science, Big Data and AI in specific business and application areas.

Furthermore, the Living Lab of ScaDS.AI Dresden/Leipzig gives researchers the opportunity to present their latest research results by using our demonstrators. Ultimately we try to inspire innovative approaches and establish a platform for further pilot projects and cooperations. All participants are invited to take part in a joint dinner at the end of the workshop. We are looking forward to interesting discussions and an enriching exchange. Further information regarding the program and registration process will soon be published here as well as on the official website of ScaDS.AI Dresden/Leipzig.">

<p><p>The talk will first sharpen the concept of data-driven software. Then, typical requirements for data-driven software systems will be discussed and illustrated with examples. From the requirements, it will be derived what software processes for the development of data-driven software systems should look like. In the context of ML/DEV/OPS, it will be discussed how the development of “machine learning” components affects the operation of data-driven systems. *German talk</p>

  Recommendation System in Industrial Context</h3>












<a href="https://github.com/ManishBhandariV">Manish Bhandari</a>, Data Scientist <a href="https://xitaso.com/">Xitaso GmbH</a>





<p><p>In recent years, there has been a rapid advancement in the field of machine learning, especially deep learning. These advancements have resulted in the emergence of technologies where artificial intelligence assists human activities and sometimes even performs rudimentary and repetitive human tasks. Most of these developments are concentrated in day-to-day human activities. Be it the use of recommendation systems to assist humans’ in picking the right movies or recommending items they might like or translating speech and texts from one language to another. Nevertheless, these advancements can also potentially extend to an industrial context such as the production industry or construction industry. These industries mainly rely on the experience of domain experts to make complex decisions in various situations by analysing decisive parameters. In such cases, artificial intelligence can assist domain experts in making decisions by readily providing data-driven recommendations. These recommendations can then be reviewed by domain experts to make the final decision. In this talk, I would like to present such a use case where a custom-developed recommendation system using language models and vector databases assists domain experts in the construction industry in decision making.</p>

<p><p>In order to improve product quality, SENEC GmbH has launched a project to establish a Predictive maintenance system. Based on frequently repeating failure patterns and reasons for and reasons for failure in electricity storage systems, the underlying assumption is that these patterns can be predicted using statistical analysis and AI methods, these patterns can be predicted to a certain extent. In order to fully undertake this research, SENEC is collaborating with IT-Sonix GmbH together. In the presentation we would like to introduce the technical approach and inform about the current status of the project. *German talk</p>

  Bridging the gap between Science and Business: Challenges, Opportunities, Use-Cases (GER) </h3>












<a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Sebastian_Lehmann100">Dr.  Sebastian Lehmann</a>, Senior AI Engineer, <a href="https://appsfactory.de/">Appsfactory GmbH</a>





<p><p>Establishing transforming services using AI technologies in business is still a challenging task. Not only does one have to operate under strict constraints like time, budget and quality but also what is practical in real use case scenarios differs from the academic view. We discuss recent projects using AI at Appsfactory in terms of customer steering, project management, staffing and technical deep dive. Additionally outlined will be successful assessment strategies as an opportunity for better quality control.</p>

<a href="https://de.linkedin.com/in/maximilian-pensel-052890204">Maximilian Pensel </a>, Data Scientist, <a href="https://www.alexanderthamm.com/">Alexander Thamm GmbH</a>





<p><p>Diversity of existing and new knowledge and technologies represent a recurring challenge in our everyday life.
It is unlikely to find a final answer to these challenges in this fast-moving field, so a continuous and flexible approach, driven by experience, is essential. In the presentation, the methods and technologies of Alexander Thamm GmbH in dealing with these challenges will be presented. Explicitly, it will be about our structuring of data projects and knowledge fields through the Data Journey, as well as our approaches to knowledge consolidation, such as casebase.ai and the Techradar. *German talk</p>

  AI in E-Commerce and Retail: Where are we?  (GER)</h3>












<a href="https://de.linkedin.com/in/jensscholz">Jens Scholz</a>, CEO <a href="https://prudsys.de/">prudys AG</a>





<p><p>From the warehouse to the customer, smart algorithms are changing retail, because retail – like other industries – is facing major challenges. Customers expect permanent availability of services and goods – online and in stores – and at the same time an individually-tailored shopping experience. In addition, retail is under permanent margin pressure and is confronted with extensive digitization of its own processes for competitive reasons. Artificial intelligence plays out its potential in all these fields. The presentation aims to give an overview of the state of the application and shed light on some best practice examples. *German talk</p>
