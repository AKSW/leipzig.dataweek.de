Program

Users of Big Data-technologies and AI in business and research will be given the opportunity to talk about their practical insights as well as challenges. We invite you to actively join the discussion and take part at BDIB 2022.
BDIB aims to foster the transfer of research results in the areas Big Data, Data Science and AI into business applications. Furthermore we want to improve the practical and professional exchange of information between application partners and stakeholders in the Big Data and AI industry. Speakers of regionally and internationally operating organisations will present their practical experiences regarding new methods in Data Science, Big Data and AI in specific business and application areas.

Furthermore, the Living Lab of ScaDS.AI Dresden/Leipzig gives researchers the opportunity to present their latest research results by using our demonstrators. Ultimately we try to inspire innovative approaches and establish a platform for further pilot projects and cooperations. All participants are invited to take part in a joint dinner at the end of the workshop. We are looking forward to interesting discussions and an enriching exchange. Further information regarding the program and registration process will soon be published here as well as on the official website of ScaDS.AI Dresden/Leipzig.">

His research focus is software processes for the development of data-driven and mobile applications as well as cyber-physical systems.</p>
</div></div></div>





<p><p>The talk will first sharpen the concept of data-driven software. Then, typical requirements for data-driven software systems will be discussed and illustrated with examples. From the requirements, it will be derived what software processes for the development of data-driven software systems should look like. In the context of ML/DEV/OPS, it will be discussed how the development of “machine learning” components affects the operation of data-driven systems.</p>
