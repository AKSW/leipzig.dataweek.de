SUMMARY:Digital transformation of organisations or processes through AI
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20230629T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20230629T123000
DESCRIPTION:The contributions to the session will highlight opportunities 
 for the digital transformation of organizations and processes through the 
 use of AI. The possible applications are diverse and range from the optimi
 zation of workflows and efficiency increases to the development of innovat
 ive business models based on AI methods. Specific real-world examples will
  be presented and discussed on how AI-based solutions can be used in diffe
 rent industries.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20230629T133000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20230629T150000
DESCRIPTION:This session will highlight the positive impact and opportunit
 ies of AI on society. The presented papers show how AI-based technologies 
 can contribute to solving societal challenges\, e.g. in law enforcement. E
 thical aspects will be discussed and questions about responsibility and tr
 ansparency in dealing with AI will be raised. The session will provide spa
 ce for a broad dialogue on the impact of AI on society and possible strate
 gies to make the most of the benefits of AI.

SUMMARY:Alexander Thamm Training
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20230629T153000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20230629T180000
DESCRIPTION:In the training\, the creation of a synthetic dataset suitable
  for the use case will be explained and presented. Using the already prepa
 red images\, the participants will then implement and train Convolutional 
 Neural Networks (CNNs) that recognize the extent of graffiti in relation t
 o the image area. The learning goal is to develop a sense of the strengths
  and weaknesses of neural networks in image analysis\, in addition to "han
 ds-on" testing of CNNs including tuning of hyperparameters. This will be d
 one within the classic data science life cycle of data pre-processing\, mo
 del implementation\, model evaluation\, and error analysis. Prerequisite f
 or participation is rudimentary Python knowledge - or experience with othe
 r programming languages.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20230629T090000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20230629T103000
DESCRIPTION:The training is aimed at those who want to take their first st
 eps in Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) and get to kno
 w the corresponding application possibilities. During the training\, basic
  principles of AI/ML as well as various methods of supervised and unsuperv
 ised ML are taught\, as well as the procedure for training and evaluating 
 ML models. Finally\, what has been learned will be applied to an example u
 sing the Python programming language and corresponding libraries (includin
 g Pandas\, Scikit-learn).\nNo prerequisites necessary.
