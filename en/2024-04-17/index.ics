SUMMARY:Knowledge transfer and replication - many ideas\, little clarity
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T112000
DESCRIPTION:The funded smart city measures are intended to generate a broa
 d impact throughout Germany in order to advance digitalization topics. Wit
 hin the CUT project\, Leipzig is trying to find ways of transferring and r
 eplicating knowledge in order to impart helpful knowledge to other cities 
 in such a way that they are empowered to build their own urban digital twi
 ns. After all\, what knowledge is actually relevant and what do other citi
 es need? We are therefore interested in exchanging ideas with other cities
  in order to find out what common ideas and solutions already exist for kn
 owledge transfer and the transferability of solutions.

SUMMARY:Toolbox Datenkompetenz - Training Designing a city with data - Sma

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T123000
DESCRIPTION:The term Smart City\, understood in the sense of an innovative
 \, technology-driven development concept of the urban space\, is primarily
  based on the beneficial\, secure handling of data by all involved actors.
  With the Smart City training\, we want to invite the participants to go t
 hrough the data cycle together using an example with open data from the fi
 eld of urban development. In the interaction between government\, research
 \, industry and citizens\, ways of implementing the concept of a more live
 able\, progressive\, ecological and socially inclusive\, data-driven city 
 can be demonstrated. The Toolbox Datenkompetenz (TBDK\, https://beta.toolb
 oxdatenkompetenz.de/) is a platform for learning all aspects of working wi
 th data and offers a Jupyter notebook environment for individual processin
 g of data projects. In order to work with the data\, it is recommended to 
 bring a laptop. However\, participation in the training will also be possi
 ble without your own laptop. Prior knowledge in the areas addressed in the
  training is beneficial\, but not required.
