DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T123000
DESCRIPTION:In addition to developing and expanding their personal data li
 teracy\, participants can take away a deeper insight into the data cycle f
 rom the training\, as they can recognise and fill their own knowledge gaps
  and also present their knowledge to other participants in a profitable wa
 y. Reference is also made to the Toolbox Data Literacy (TBDK) platform\, w
 here participants can develop and expand their data literacy independently
  and free of charge during and after the training. The programme is divide
 d into three parts\, starting with the formulation of questions on this to
 pic\, followed by interactive hands-on application (including working with
  a Jupyter notebook) using a practical example and concluding with an open
  discussion round.
