SUMMARY:Leipzig\, how are you? - A walk through sensor technology and user
 -generated data
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250610T161000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250610T174000
DESCRIPTION:Sensors are increasingly appearing in Leipzig's cityscape and 
 are needed as a technology for ‘measuring’ urban tasks. In addition to
  sensors\, citizen and user-generated data is an as yet untapped treasure 
 for sustainable urban development. On our walk through Leipzig's city cent
 re\, you will discover where and how sensors and data donations are used i
 n the city and how they are already making our city smarter today (start: 
 New City Hall\, destination: Smart City Lab)

SUMMARY:Citizen and user-generated data - an (unexploited) treasure for su
 stainable urban development?
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250610T123000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250610T140000
DESCRIPTION:Digital participation generates qualitative data in particular
 . Such data is collected by citizens and is therefore often closer to the 
 reality of their own lives and provides information about the local qualit
 y of life. In this workshop\, we will look at what information and data is
  generated in the context of digital participation and how citizen-generat
 ed data can be meaningfully processed and integrated into our urban databa
 se.

SUMMARY:Keeping an eye on urban greenery with satellite data
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250610T143000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250610T160000
DESCRIPTION:In the training course\, they learn how they can use satellite
  data to assess the stock of urban greenery and analyse its development.\n
 \nIn the UrbanGreenEye project\, Senitel2 data sets were used to create in
 dicators for greenery\, sealing and surface temperature using AI analyses.
  The finished indicators are available to all local authorities and intere
 sted citizens as an interactive map on the homepage. It is also possible t
 o use the wms service.\n\nThe participants of the workshop will learn in a
  practical way how the information on the degree of shading\, green volume
  and sealing can be interpreted and how raster data can be used in the GIS
 . Examples will be used to demonstrate the analyses for intersection\, def
 icit and change analyses. We also want to give a brief insight into the AI
  models in order to better understand the data basis.\n\nPrevious knowledg
 e of GIS is an advantage for participation in the workshop\; having your o
 wn GIS applications on your computer makes it easier to follow up analyses

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250610T143000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250610T160000
DESCRIPTION:Using selected AI products and data platforms\, we provide a p
 ractical insight into how AI can be successfully implemented in security-c
 ritical areas. Our programme is aimed at decision-makers\, researchers and
  IT specialists from government and industry who are interested in secure 
 and data protection-compliant solutions. Participants will have the opport
 unity to discuss their own use cases and try out our products directly.
