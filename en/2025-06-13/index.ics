DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250613T103000
DESCRIPTION:Get ready to push the boundaries of industrial automation! Wit
 h our Global Thingkathon\, we’re taking co-innovation to the next level.
  At various locations around the globe\, we’ll simultaneously test and v
 alidate real-world use cases on the Smart Systems Hub’s Manufacturing-X 
 Testbed. Together with our international network of partners\, we aim to e
 xplore feasibility\, identify potential\, and bring groundbreaking solutio
 ns to life. Join us on this journey to shape the future of manufacturing! 
 The Challenge: How can we create an open and interconnected platform for t
 he industry and how can we make use of the data collected and shared? This
  Thin[gk]athon\, which is organized by the Smart Systms Hub\, is meant to 
 provide an opportunity to explore the possibilites of shared Data in the c
 ontext of Manufacturing-X. What can it be used for and how can we implemen

SUMMARY:Jugend Hackt Mini-Hackathon: Sensor technology for the living room
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250613T150000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250613T220000
DESCRIPTION:Together we assemble\, program and design autonomous soil mois
 ture sensors that can be used to monitor the water supply of indoor plants
 . The end result is a colorful and individual DIY solution that invites yo
 u to continue thinking and trying things out. The participants can take th
 eir finished sensor and output unit home to and try it out in everyday lif
 e\, develop it further themselves and modify.\n \nThis provides an opportu
 nity to gain initial experience with electronics and circuit design\, prog
 ramming languages and digital design. As an additional input\, we will pre
 sent the soil moisture sensor technology of the city of\nLeipzig\, which w
 ill be used to monitor city and park trees in real time.\n\nThe event is a
 imed at young people aged 14 to 18\, otherwise there are no prerequisites 
 or prior knowledge required. All tools and materials will be provided\, bu
 t you are welcome to bring your own laptops or tablets. We use free softwa
 re so that the skills and tools learned remain accessible.\n\nPre-registra
 tion is requested\, a link will be added here shortly.
