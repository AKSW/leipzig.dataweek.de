<p><p>Data describe sections of reality. We draw information from it. New knowledge is created. Data pave the way to a post-digital society. The benefits increase with availability and quantity. We are still stumbling over problems such as data quality, data protection and data security. But there are solutions for these. However, we pay surprisingly little attention to another type of problem: fundamental errors in thinking about data. Ignoring or denying them would be negligent and have unpleasant consequences.</p>

<h3 id="programm-session-2">
  
    
      11.00 - 12.30:
    
  
  Data for citizens/citizen participation</h3>















<p><p>No one has more information about the city than the city itself. The city can use this knowledge to improve services and planning or to make decisions more comprehensible. But the city can also share its data with others or incorporate data from others to support urban development processes. This includes, for example, user-generated data from participation projects with citizens, e.g., on city or neighborhood design. However, data sharing also raises questions about the extent of transparency, data ownership and data protection on the digital agenda of cities. In the session, we will examine the opportunities and risks of data use together.</p>

  Data for the city of the next generations</h3>















<p><p>Social data literacy should not be left to chance. Data literacy should therefore not only be a skill of future generations, but must already become a basic building block for the education of people of different ages. In this session, representatives from science, industry and administration will present innovative projects that are currently being implemented in and around Leipzig on data literacy. An outlook on new educational institutions, digital training tools and platforms will also be given.</p>

  How can arts and culture use data?</h3>















<p><p>Culture is a lifeline to a livable city. Culture is a mirror of developments, a trendsetter and at the same time a critical voice in the digital transformation of cities. How are digital innovations and the use of big data and artificial intelligence changing artistic processes and the work of cultural professionals? Together with representatives from cultural institutions, we would like to shed light on the possibilities, perspectives and problems of artistic work and cultural institutions in the course of digitalization in this session “Data for Cultural Spaces and Recreation”.</p>
