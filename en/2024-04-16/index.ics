SUMMARY:Automatic detection of thermal bridges in drone images with deep l

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T133000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T140000
DESCRIPTION:Thermal bridges are weak points in the building envelope that 
 can lead to energy losses\, moisture accumulation and mold growth in the b
 uilding fabric. Drones with thermographic cameras can be used to detect th
 ermal bridges in large building stocks. To this end\, we have created a fr
 eely available data set comprising 926 high-resolution 5-channel images (R
 GB\, thermal and height) with 6\,927 annotations and cataloged according t
 o FAIR principles. Using deep learning\, we also automatically analyzed th
 is extensive set of panoramic image data of the Karlsruhe roofs and segmen
 ted thermal bridges. In our experiments\, we use current neural model arch
 itectures: MaskRCNN R18\, MaskRCNN R50\, Swin-T Transformer\, TridentNet\,
  FSAF with and without pre-training. During training\, we also determined 
 the electrical energy required for the learning process.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T140000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T143000
DESCRIPTION:In our latitudes\, there is a regular demand for heating energ
 y in buildings in winter and an increasing demand for cooling energy in su
 mmer due to climate change. It therefore makes sense to aim for a seasonal
  shift in regenerative heating and cooling by tapping into large storage m
 asses\, for which the use of the ground by means of near-surface geotherma
 l energy is predestined.  Near-surface geothermal energy offers a whole ra
 nge of different technologies\, e.g. flat collectors\, energy baskets or b
 orehole fields\, as well as agrothermal\, river and tunnel thermal energy\
 , and enables a sustainable supply of heating and cooling from sources ava
 ilable on site or in the immediate vicinity.

DESCRIPTION:How can data spaces and ecosystems be designed in such a way t
 hat a fair and trust-based data economy can emerge? Practical examples ran
 ging from the use of personal data across different offices (City of Helsi

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T160000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T163000
DESCRIPTION:The Office for Urban Greenery and Water (Amt für Stadtgrün u
 nd Gewässer) is responsible for the maintenance and development of the ur
 ban green-blue infrastructure and thus makes a valuable contribution to an
  attractive and vibrant city of Leipzig. In order to digitally map the pla
 nning\, construction and management processes\, from mobile working to adm
 inistrative procedures and public participation\, a digital green space ma
 nagement system with a seamless workflow is being integrated into daily wo
 rk. The management system is currently being used as a mandatory digital t
 ool for the area of traffic safety for trees and play equipment. In the fu
 ture\, the entire green-blue infrastructure is to be mapped via the green 
 space management system and the data made available for climate protection
  and adaptation measures as well as the preservation of biodiversity.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T160000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T163000
DESCRIPTION:Time series predictions are a central part of optimizing moder
 n life from electricity consumption to weather forecasts to traffic flow p
 lanning.\nAlthough AI models have led to further advances in time series f
 orecasting\, classical models are still serious competitors\, especially w
 hen computational complexity and resource consumption are relevant.\nUsing
  the ReCycle framework\, we show how a good understanding of the advantage
 s and disadvantages of both approaches can improve interpretability\, effi
 ciency and precision. The result is AI models that can be trained on a sta
 ndard laptop and can keep up with or even surpass the state of the art.

SUMMARY:CIVITAS/CORE: A standard for the municipal data infrastructure
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T163000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T170000
DESCRIPTION:For some years now\, the systematic handling of digital inform
 ation and the development of associated data infrastructures has played a 
 role in almost all local authorities. However\, despite similar challenges
 \, all too often they set out on their own. Yet it is precisely the collab
 orative interaction of many municipalities that creates innovative strengt
 h and synergy effects.\nIn order to provide a decisive building block of t
 his urban data infrastructure in the long term\, a community of 12 cities 
 and municipal utilities has joined forces within the Civitas Connect assoc
 iation to jointly define the core of an urban data platform called "CIVITA
 S/CORE". In doing so\, they exchange experiences and their requirements fo
 r the provision of data for a wide range of smart city use cases in order 
 to design a generic platform. Development started in January 2024.\nMunici
 palities should address the issue of value creation at an early stage when
  considering the data platform - only if it is possible to cover a large n
 umber of relevant use cases in the municipal environment and manage the as
 sociated data sets with confidence will value-adding and therefore sustain
 able data infrastructures emerge as the core of digital services of genera
 l interest.
