DESCRIPTION:Climate change\, species extinction and resource conflicts are
  pressing issues of our time. While AI systems themselves exacerbate these
  problems through high resource consumption\, they can also help to mitiga
 te these crises if used correctly. For example\, AI can be used to better 
 understand (and thus better protect) the environment\, use natural resourc
 es more efficiently\, optimize energy production or improve classical comp
 uter models and thus save energy. In this session\, 4 speakers from resear
 ch\, administration and society will present how we can make AI more susta
 inable and how AI and data-driven methods can contribute to environmental 
 and nature conservation.

DESCRIPTION:CoSI – the Cockpit Urban Infrastructure – is a comprehensi

  transparent and well-founded decisions in urban and social space planning
 . It links data from various sources such as specialized authorities and c
 ompanies and integrates spatial and temporal analyses as well as scenario 
 planning. With interactive maps and user-friendly tools\, CoSI supports ne
 tworked and data-driven planning. Used at individual workstations and on d
 igital touch tables\, CoSI has already been used in collaborative workshop
 s for applications ranging from urban district development to site selecti
 on for wind turbines. Transferred from research to productive operation in
  Hamburg\, we present CoSI as a tool for efficient and inclusive urban dev
 elopment\, smart governance and digital administration.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T133000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T140000
DESCRIPTION:Thermal bridges are weak points in the building envelope that 
 can lead to energy losses\, moisture accumulation and mold growth in the b
 uilding fabric. Drones with thermographic cameras can be used to detect th
 ermal bridges in large building stocks. To this end\, we have created a fr
 eely available data set comprising 926 high-resolution 5-channel images (R
 GB\, thermal and height) with 6\,927 annotations and cataloged according t
 o FAIR principles. Using deep learning\, we also automatically analyzed th
 is extensive set of panoramic image data of the Karlsruhe roofs and segmen
 ted thermal bridges. In our experiments\, we use current neural model arch
 itectures: MaskRCNN R18\, MaskRCNN R50\, Swin-T Transformer\, TridentNet\,
  FSAF with and without pre-training. During training\, we also determined 
 the electrical energy required for the learning process.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T140000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T143000
DESCRIPTION:In our latitudes\, there is a regular demand for heating energ
 y in buildings in winter and an increasing demand for cooling energy in su
 mmer due to climate change. It therefore makes sense to aim for a seasonal
  shift in regenerative heating and cooling by tapping into large storage m
 asses\, for which the use of the ground by means of near-surface geotherma
 l energy is predestined.  Near-surface geothermal energy offers a whole ra
 nge of different technologies\, e.g. flat collectors\, energy baskets or b
 orehole fields\, as well as agrothermal\, river and tunnel thermal energy\
 , and enables a sustainable supply of heating and cooling from sources ava
 ilable on site or in the immediate vicinity.

DESCRIPTION:Preparing and providing environmental data is complex and time

  data management for environmental data - traditional approaches are being
  reconsidered and new innovative digital solutions are being used. A new m
 ethod for interoperable data management is being applied that links the en

 analyzed and processed across different topics.  Using noise as an applica

 nagement system with a seamless workflow is being integrated into daily wo
 rk. The management system is currently being used as a mandatory digital t

DESCRIPTION:Time series predictions are a central part of optimizing moder
 n life from electricity consumption to weather forecasts to traffic flow p
 lanning.\nAlthough AI models have led to further advances in time series f
 orecasting\, classical models are still serious competitors\, especially w
 hen computational complexity and resource consumption are relevant.\nUsing
  the ReCycle framework\, we show how a good understanding of the advantage
 s and disadvantages of both approaches can improve interpretability\, effi
 ciency and precision. The result is AI models that can be trained on a sta
 ndard laptop and can keep up with or even surpass the state of the art.

SUMMARY:CIVITAS/CORE: A standard for the municipal data infrastructure
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T163000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240416T170000
DESCRIPTION:For some years now\, the systematic handling of digital inform
 ation and the development of associated data infrastructures has played a 
 role in almost all local authorities. However\, despite similar challenges
 \, all too often they set out on their own. Yet it is precisely the collab
 orative interaction of many municipalities that creates innovative strengt
 h and synergy effects.\nIn order to provide a decisive building block of t
 his urban data infrastructure in the long term\, a community of 12 cities 
 and municipal utilities has joined forces within the Civitas Connect assoc
 iation to jointly define the core of an urban data platform called "CIVITA
 S/CORE". In doing so\, they exchange experiences and their requirements fo
 r the provision of data for a wide range of smart city use cases in order 
 to design a generic platform. Development started in January 2024.\nMunici
 palities should address the issue of value creation at an early stage when
  considering the data platform - only if it is possible to cover a large n
 umber of relevant use cases in the municipal environment and manage the as
 sociated data sets with confidence will value-adding and therefore sustain
 able data infrastructures emerge as the core of digital services of genera
 l interest.
