SUMMARY:How generative artificial intelligence is changing work and study 
 (organized by ScaDS.AI)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260602T133000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260602T150000
DESCRIPTION:Modern AI-driven chat apps such as ChatGPT\, Gemini\, Claude a
 nd others are changing the way we work unavoidably. For many\, this means 
 writing texts or programming more efficiently. Some people overestimate th
 e quality of generated text and may not admit that they have not curated A
 I-generated text properly. About 20 years ago we had to learn how to “go
 ogle” properly\, today we need to learn how to “prompt”. In this lec
 ture\, we will give an insight into various challenges that the current AI
  revolution is imposing on us and a number of opportunities in this contex
 t. The lecture gives examples\, tips and tricks for dealing with Generativ
 e AI and will be followed by a practical part. It is recommended that you 
 bring your own laptop to take part.
