SUMMARY:Communication is key: Why Data Scientists Must Be Able to Do More 
 Than Code & Data
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20230628T091500
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20230628T094500
DESCRIPTION:In our talk\, we describe the small and big pitfalls that can 
 occur in the life of a Data Scientist. Coming from the "safe space" of the
  university\, where you can tinker around in your own Git repository\, you
  suddenly have to work with many other people in your everyday professiona
 l life. "Hell\, it's the others\," says Sartre. Well\, it may not be quite
  that bad. Still\, it makes sense to deal with the different perspectives 
 and expectations of everyone involved. How do I communicate with platform 
 architects and data protection officers? What do I need to consider in cus
 tomer contact? What do my superiors expect from me - and I from them? Am I
  allowed to make mistakes? Which tools and procedures help in collaboratio
 n? Using concrete examples\, we show why Data Scientists need to be able t
 o do much more than analyze data and write code. And why exactly that make
 s the job so exciting.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20230628T111500
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20230628T120000
DESCRIPTION:Leadership today means first and foremost self-leadership. For
  this\, it is important to understand one's own (emergency) patterns and b
 eliefs and to find a way of dealing with them that does not collapse at th
 e first stress test. Only then can I credibly exemplify to my team\, do ne
 w\, meaningful and courageous things that we did not think were possible b

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20230628T130000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20230628T134500
DESCRIPTION:The joy of working is dwindling more and more: projects runnin
 g in parallel\, short deadlines\, unregulated communication and permanent 
 interruptions cause the stress level to rise more and more. Digitalization
  creates many challenges in everyday work that need to be overcome. In thi
 s presentation\, we will therefore take a look at what productive and heal
