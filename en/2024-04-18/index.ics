DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T090000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T100000
DESCRIPTION:Using an open innovation approach with the help of the establi
 shed "Hackathon" format\, we aim to test new use cases for collecting\, an
 alysing and networking clinical health data in particular together with in
 terdisciplinary teams as part of Data Week Leipzig. Impulses from healthca
 re practice\, scientific research/analytics and IT complement each other o
 n an equal footing.\n\nA hackathon ("to hack"\, "marathon") or datathon is
  an ideas competition aimed at realising innovative solutions/prototypes i
 n a short space of time. Participants work in interdisciplinary teams on c
 hallenging issues - which are brought in by partners or the participants t
 hemselves. The results are presented to an audience and usually assessed b
 y a jury.\n\nThe Datathon's questions come from practice partners in the h
 ealthcare sector\, in particular a large university hospital in Leipzig\, 
 as well as the participating environment\, in order to achieve relevant an
 d realisable results that ideally provide added value for the healthcare s
 ystem. Our aim is to work not only theoretically\, but also on the basis o
 f concrete (anonymised/pseudonymised) data sets provided for the participa

DESCRIPTION:In the rapidly evolving world of software development\, the in
 tegration of large language models such as GPT4 or WizardCoder into progra
 mming practice has become increasingly essential. The training dives into 
 the world of AI-assisted Python programming and provides comprehensive lea
 rning content aimed at improving participants' programming skills. The mai
 n focus is on using AI tools to improve existing code bases\, simplify com
 plex code to increase readability and maintainability\, and write effectiv
 e test cases that ensure code robustness. In addition\, the training provi
 des insights into increasing code efficiency\, optimizing performance and 
 reducing resource consumption. A significant part is dedicated to debuggin
 g techniques that enable participants to quickly identify and fix code ano
 malies using AI-driven approaches. The training is designed as an interact
 ive and hands-on learning experience and equips participants with the nece
 ssary skills to integrate AI into their programming practices\, resulting 
 in higher quality and efficient software development.
