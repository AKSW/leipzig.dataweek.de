DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T100000
DESCRIPTION:Using an open innovation approach with the help of the establi
 shed "Hackathon" format\, we aim to test new use cases for collecting\, an
 alysing and networking clinical health data in particular together with in
 terdisciplinary teams as part of Data Week Leipzig. Impulses from healthca
 re practice\, scientific research/analytics and IT complement each other o
 n an equal footing.\n\nA hackathon ("to hack"\, "marathon") or datathon is
  an ideas competition aimed at realising innovative solutions/prototypes i
 n a short space of time. Participants work in interdisciplinary teams on c
 hallenging issues - which are brought in by partners or the participants t
 hemselves. The results are presented to an audience and usually assessed b
 y a jury.\n\nThe Datathon's questions come from practice partners in the h
 ealthcare sector\, in particular a large university hospital in Leipzig\, 
 as well as the participating environment\, in order to achieve relevant an
 d realisable results that ideally provide added value for the healthcare s
 ystem. Our aim is to work not only theoretically\, but also on the basis o
 f concrete (anonymised/pseudonymised) data sets provided for the participa

SUMMARY:Empowering Knowledge Graphs with AI (organized by brox-IT Solution
 s) 
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T103000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T120000
DESCRIPTION:This training introduces the enhancement of Knowledge Graphs (
 KG) with Large Language Models (LLM) and Graph Machine Learning (GML) in t
 he context of Semantic Web Technologies (SWT). The Knowledge Graph\, a cru
 cial component of the Semantic Web\, holds substantial potential for trans
 forming various industries\, despite facing challenges like integration di
 fficulties and its requirement for developers with specialized expertise. 
 On the other hand\, Large Language Models\, though showing promise\, encou
 nter uncertainties such as hallucination in outputs and high operational c
 osts. The training emphasises a synergistic approach\, showcasing how LLMs
  and GML contribute to KG construction\, addressing issues like data clean
 ing and relation extraction. The focus is on utilising open-source technol
 ogies for KG construction\, aiming to assist industries in harnessing the 
 benefits of this technology. The targeted audience includes individuals or
  groups interested in digitisation with minimal prior knowledge of KGs\, p
 roviding them with a streamlined workflow for proof of concept within thei
 r organisations. The training materials will be accessible via a GitHub re
 pository\, and feedback sessions will be provided to address general quest
 ions. Specific or in-depth inquiries will receive dedicated support post-t
 raining\, particularly if the number of participants exceeds 15.

 plex code to increase readability and maintainability\, and write effectiv
 e test cases that ensure code robustness. In addition\, the training provi
 des insights into increasing code efficiency\, optimizing performance and 
 reducing resource consumption. A significant part is dedicated to debuggin
 g techniques that enable participants to quickly identify and fix code ano
 malies using AI-driven approaches. The training is designed as an interact
 ive and hands-on learning experience and equips participants with the nece
 ssary skills to integrate AI into their programming practices\, resulting 
 in higher quality and efficient software development.
