SUMMARY:Data Skills Bootcamp: Basics of Data Literacy for Professionals (o
 rganized by Dilyana Bossenz)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T103000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T120000
DESCRIPTION:Immerse yourself in the exciting world of data analysis and da
 ta visualization! In this half-day training\, we will familiarize you with
  the basics and guide you through the day-to-day work of a real data analy
 st: Gabriel. He is a trained journalist who has decided to change careers 
 and now works as a data analyst. Together we will look at two practical ca
 se studies in which Gabriel effectively analyzes data and prepares it in a
  visually appealing way. This will give you an authentic insight into the 
 techniques of data analysis and presentation that you can apply directly i
 n your day-to-day work.

SUMMARY:Data management (organized by ScaDS.AI)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T103000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T120000
DESCRIPTION:The data management session will take a closer look at the lif
 e cycle of data. How is data created\, what happens to it when it is proce
 ssed? Who owns the data and who is responsible for publishing\, archiving 
 and\, if necessary\, reusing it? We will use ChatGPT to design a data mana
 gement plan. After an introduction to the topic\, we will work in groups.

SUMMARY:AI-assisted Coding: Increasing Code Quality and Efficiency (organi

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T130000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T143000
DESCRIPTION:In the rapidly evolving world of software development\, the in
 tegration of large language models such as GPT4 or WizardCoder into progra
 mming practice has become increasingly essential. The training dives into 
 the world of AI-assisted Python programming and provides comprehensive lea
 rning content aimed at improving participants' programming skills. The mai
 n focus is on using AI tools to improve existing code bases\, simplify com
 plex code to increase readability and maintainability\, and write effectiv
 e test cases that ensure code robustness. In addition\, the training provi
 des insights into increasing code efficiency\, optimizing performance and 
 reducing resource consumption. A significant part is dedicated to debuggin
 g techniques that enable participants to quickly identify and fix code ano
 malies using AI-driven approaches. The training is designed as an interact
 ive and hands-on learning experience and equips participants with the nece
 ssary skills to integrate AI into their programming practices\, resulting 
 in higher quality and efficient software development.
