SUMMARY:Generative AI in practice: strategies\, tools\, and success factor
 s for effective implementation in companies (conducted by Digital Impact L
 abs Leipzig GmbH) 
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260604T090000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260604T103000
DESCRIPTION:Generative AI has arrived in companies\, but the path from ini
 tial experiments to actual application is often challenging. In this pract
 ice-oriented workshop\, experts from GenAI Hub Leipzig will work with part
 icipants to develop ways to successfully integrate AI into existing work p
 rocesses. Topics include suitable use cases\, prioritization\, governance\
 , data protection\, tool selection\, change management\, and employee trai
 ning. Through interactive exercises\, practical examples\, and discussions
 \, participants will learn concrete strategies for measurable improvements
  and the next steps in their companies. The workshop is primarily aimed at
  managers and HR professionals.

SUMMARY:Open-source dashboards for climate resilience and international da
 ta usage – hands-on with Apache Superset in the Horizon Europe project G
 RACE (conducted by aconium GmbH)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260604T090000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260604T103000
DESCRIPTION:In the EU project GRACE (Growing Climate Resilience in Remote 
 Rural Areas through Community Empowerment)\, European partners are working
  to strengthen the climate resilience of rural regions with the help of fr
 eely accessible data and digital technologies. In this workshop\, particip
 ants will create their own open\, interactive dashboard and learn step by 
 step how to make meaningful use of publicly available map and specialist d
 ata. This includes geodata from OpenStreetMap (OSM) – a global\, collabo
 ratively maintained free map platform – as well as supplementary factual
  information such as climate or population data. We will demonstrate in a 
 practical way how freely available data can be turned into understandable 
 visualizations and why the conscious use of data is more important than th
 e tool used. Using Apache Superset\, participants will gain insights into 
 open-source visualization\, international data use\, and the role of dashb
 oards in climate-resilient\, data-driven decision-making processes.
