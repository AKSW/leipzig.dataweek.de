SUMMARY:Generative AI in practice: strategies\, tools\, and success factor

 abs Leipzig GmbH) 
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260604T090000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260604T103000
DESCRIPTION:Generative AI has arrived in companies\, but the path from ini
 tial experiments to actual application is often challenging. In this pract
 ice-oriented workshop\, experts from GenAI Hub Leipzig will work with part
 icipants to develop ways to successfully integrate AI into existing work p
 rocesses. Topics include suitable use cases\, prioritization\, governance\
 , data protection\, tool selection\, change management\, and employee trai
 ning. Through interactive exercises\, practical examples\, and discussions
 \, participants will learn concrete strategies for measurable improvements
  and the next steps in their companies. The workshop is primarily aimed at
  managers and HR professionals.

DESCRIPTION:This session takes participants on an expedition through the w
 orld of artificial intelligence: from its origins and how modern AI system

 use AI\, but to understand it thoroughly and apply it consciously.

SUMMARY:Open-source dashboards for climate resilience and international da
 ta usage – hands-on with Apache Superset in the Horizon Europe project G
 RACE (conducted by aconium GmbH)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260604T090000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260604T103000
DESCRIPTION:How can climate data be processed in such a way that it really
  has an impact? In the EU project GRACE (Growing Climate Resilience in Rem
 ote Rural Areas through Community Empowerment)\, European partners are wor
 king to strengthen the climate resilience of rural regions with the help o
 f freely accessible data and digital technologies. In this workshop\, part
 icipants will create their own open\, interactive dashboard and learn step
  by step how to make meaningful use of publicly available maps and special
 ist data. This includes geodata from OpenStreetMap (OSM) – a global\, co
 llaboratively maintained free map platform – as well as supplementary fa
 ctual information such as climate or population data. We will demonstrate 
 in a practical way how freely available data can be turned into understand
 able visualizations and why the conscious use of data is more important th
 an the tool used. Using Apache Superset\, participants gain insights into 
 open-source visualization\, international data use\, and the role of dashb
 oards in climate-resilient\, data-driven decision-making processes. \nPart
 icipants are strongly encouraged to bring their own computers to the works
 hop. The necessary data sets will be provided in advance by the organizers
 .

SUMMARY:Practical guide to the EU AI Act – Assessing risks\, understandi
 ng obligations\, making decisions – Part 2 (conducted by EWERK)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260604T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260604T123000
DESCRIPTION:The EU AI Act imposes new regulatory requirements on companies
 —and thus presents them with considerable challenges. In this interactiv
 e session\, various practical scenarios will be used to show how the legal
  framework can be applied to sample companies and how classification accor
 ding to the risk categories of the EU AI Act is carried out.\nLearn about 
 the applicable obligations\, the relevant deadlines\, and the business imp
 lications you can expect. We offer insights into how companies can make in
 formed and responsible decisions when using AI.
