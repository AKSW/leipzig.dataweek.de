 life\, but it also brings new challenges. As part of Data Week\, we invite
  you to discover a new form of remote working: experience what it's like t
 o “be there without being there” with telepresence robots. Take part i
 n a short study or watch the application on video and share your experienc

SUMMARY:Panel: Technically complicated and uncertain in terms of data prot
 ection law\, but unbeatably effective. Why civil society needs to have mor
 e confidence in AI. (Track: Between engagement and algorithms)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260604T090000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260604T103000
DESCRIPTION:Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer a topic for the futu
 re\; it is already changing how we live\, work\, and engage with society. 
 But while companies and public authorities are increasingly using AI techn
 ologies\, civil society often lags behind. Is it too complex\, too uncerta
 in\, too many unanswered questions? Or is it a missed opportunity for grea
 ter public welfare\, participation\, and innovation?\nAI offers enormous p
 otential for civil society action\, from the automation of processes to da
 ta-based campaigns and new forms of participation. At the same time\, pres
 sing questions arise: How can data protection and ethics be guaranteed? Wh
 ere are the limits and risks? And how can AI be designed in such a way tha
 t it truly serves the common good?\nIn this discussion\, we want to highli
 ght specific examples\, challenges\, and solutions and discuss together ho
 w civil society can use AI responsibly and courageously.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260604T090000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260604T103000
DESCRIPTION:Generative AI has arrived in companies\, but the path from ini
 tial experiments to actual application is often challenging. In this pract
 ice-oriented workshop\, experts from GenAI Hub Leipzig will work with part
 icipants to develop ways to successfully integrate AI into existing work p
 rocesses. Topics include suitable use cases\, prioritization\, governance\
 , data protection\, tool selection\, change management\, and employee trai
 ning. Through interactive exercises\, practical examples\, and discussions
 \, participants will learn concrete strategies for measurable improvements
  and the next steps in their companies. The workshop is primarily aimed at

SUMMARY:Open-source dashboards for climate resilience and international da
 ta usage – hands-on with Apache Superset in the Horizon Europe project G
 RACE (conducted by aconium GmbH)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260604T090000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260604T103000
DESCRIPTION:How can climate data be processed in such a way that it really
  has an impact? In the EU project GRACE (Growing Climate Resilience in Rem
 ote Rural Areas through Community Empowerment)\, European partners are wor
 king to strengthen the climate resilience of rural regions with the help o
 f freely accessible data and digital technologies. In this workshop\, part
 icipants will create their own open\, interactive dashboard and learn step
  by step how to make meaningful use of publicly available maps and special
 ist data. This includes geodata from OpenStreetMap (OSM) – a global\, co
 llaboratively maintained free map platform – as well as supplementary fa
 ctual information such as climate or population data. We will demonstrate 
 in a practical way how freely available data can be turned into understand
 able visualizations and why the conscious use of data is more important th
 an the tool used. Using Apache Superset\, participants gain insights into 
 open-source visualization\, international data use\, and the role of dashb
 oards in climate-resilient\, data-driven decision-making processes. \nPart
 icipants are strongly encouraged to bring their own computers to the works
 hop. The necessary data sets will be provided in advance by the organizers
 .
