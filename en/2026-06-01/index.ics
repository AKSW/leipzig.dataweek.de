SUMMARY:Leipzig\, how are you? - A walk through sensor technology and user
 -generated data
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T161000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T174000
DESCRIPTION:Sensors are increasingly appearing in Leipzig's cityscape and 
 are needed as a technology for ‘measuring’ urban tasks. In addition to
  sensors\, citizen and user-generated data is an as yet untapped treasure 
 for sustainable urban development. On our walk through Leipzig's city cent
 re\, you will discover where and how sensors and data donations are used i
 n the city and how they are already making our city smarter today (start: 
 New City Hall\, destination: Smart City Lab\, approx. 3\,5km)

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T123000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T140000
DESCRIPTION:The workshop is aimed at stakeholders from the municipal secto
 r and deals with municipal digitization today and tomorrow. Using the exam
 ple of insect mortality in the fictional town of Eichenfurt\, we show how 
 municipal data is collected\, processed\, and visualized—and what role a
  digital ecosystem plays in this. We then look ahead: in the Germany 2040 
 scenario\, we work together to develop the digital municipality of tomorro

SUMMARY:Open Data without Code (conducted by the DoorCE team at aconium Gm
 bH)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T123000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T140000
DESCRIPTION:Test the DoorCE Toolbox for the entire open data lifecycle: In
  this workshop\, participants will learn how to use the Open Data Toolbox\
 , which was developed for managing open data at the municipal level\, to u
 pload\, describe\, license\, and publish data sets without requiring a hig
 h level of technical expertise. The architecture of the toolbox will be pr
 esented\, from modules for data preparation to metadata and license manage
 ment to interfaces (APIs) that enable real-time data usage. Participants c
 an try out the individual steps for themselves using sample data sets from
  the pilot municipalities of the Interreg Central Europe project DoorCE (D
 ata Opener Central Europe)\, preferably with their own laptop. The low-cod
 e/no-code principles of the toolbox are designed to enable even non-techni
 cal employees in administrations and organizations to actively participate
  in shaping open data processes. In addition to practical application\, th
 e organizational and legal framework conditions for data opening will also
  be discussed: What strategies and governance structures are necessary? Ho
 w can cultural change towards open administration be achieved? https://www
 .interreg-central.eu/projects/doorce/

SUMMARY:From governance to guardrails: Testing and monitoring as the found
 ation of trustworthy AI (conducted by EWERK)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T143000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T160000
DESCRIPTION:How can we not only demand trust and reliability in the use of
  artificial intelligence\, but also put it into practice? In this session\
 , we bridge the gap between governance principles and the specific challen
 ges of everyday AI operations. The focus is on testing/evaluation and cont
 inuous monitoring. These aspects are more than just technical details. Rat
 her\, they form the basis for responsible and stable AI systems with real 
 added value for your company. We take a practical look at how current meth
 ods and approaches can help to better understand the behavior of AI applic
 ations and identify challenges at an early stage.
