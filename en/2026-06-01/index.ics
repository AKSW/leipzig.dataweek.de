SUMMARY:Leipzig\, how are you? - A walk through sensor technology and user
 -generated data
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T161000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T174000
DESCRIPTION:Sensors are increasingly appearing in Leipzig's cityscape and 
 are needed as a technology for ‘measuring’ urban tasks. In addition to
  sensors\, citizen and user-generated data is an as yet untapped treasure 
 for sustainable urban development. On our walk through Leipzig's city cent
 re\, you will discover where and how sensors and data donations are used i
 n the city and how they are already making our city smarter today (start: 
 New City Hall\, destination: Smart City Lab\, approx. 3\,5km)

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T143000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T160000
DESCRIPTION:The session highlights the digital lifecycle of public informa
 tion\, from its creation and legally compliant storage to long-term archiv
 ing and reuse as open data. Using the practical example of the city admini
 stration of Leipzig\, the current implementation status\, technical and le
 gal framework conditions\, and strategic development goals of digital admi
 nistration will be presented. In addition\, researchers will present new f
 reely available data sets for the automatic recognition of handwritten Ger
 man texts (published via Zenodo) and show how modern AI models contribute 
 to the indexing of analog information in industrial and administrative con
 texts. The overarching European framework is provided by the EOSC EDEN pro
 ject\, which strengthens strategies for long-term digital archiving and da
 ta availability. The session combines governance\, technology\, and practi
 ce and invites interdisciplinary discussion on future infrastructures and 
 usage perspectives.

 t platform for strengthening resilience and developing sustainable busines
 s models. Here\, ideas become projects\, lone warriors become strong netwo
 rks\, and visions become concrete solutions.\n\nIn addition to technical i
 nput and news from the administration\, you can expect to exchange ideas w
 ith other committed companies. The meeting offers an opportunity to networ
 k and gain inspiration for the next steps on the path to climate neutralit
 y.

SUMMARY:AI-ready data – the foundation for real AI success
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T133000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T140000
DESCRIPTION:AI-ready data forms the indispensable basis for successful AI 
 initiatives\, as unclear data quality and a lack of transparency are among
  the most common reasons for project failure. A structured 360° view of t
 he data landscape reveals existing data treasures\, enables realistic use 
 case evaluations\, and provides clarity about potential and gaps. The FAIR
  criteria serve as a framework for sustainable and high-performance data q
 uality. By focusing on data maturity measures\, which range from data inve
 ntory and maturity assessment to the derivation of concrete measures\, the
  path to a robust database is systematically outlined. Supplemented by pra
 ctical experience and lessons learned\, we show how companies can optimize
  their data landscape in a targeted manner and thus ensure the future viab
 ility of data-driven AI projects.

SUMMARY:Tomorrow's archiving – the data lifecycle in public administrati
 on
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T143000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T150000
DESCRIPTION:Public administration files and information go through a compl
 ex life cycle that is regulated by law from data creation to deletion or a
 rchiving and has been practiced for many years. But how do the legal requi
 rements that form the basis of the digital life cycle translate to digital
  administration? In this context\, the goal of electronic archiving is alw
 ays to generate open data. During the event\, which will feature a fluid t
 ransition between lectures and workshops\, the current status and developm
 ent goals will be clearly illustrated using the example of Leipzig's city 
 administration. The presentation will also explicitly address limiting fac
 tors such as legal requirements\, capacities\, interface developments\, an
 d expectations. The event will conclude with an interdisciplinary and open
 -ended discussion about prospects\, expectations\, and visions for the fut
 ure.

SUMMARY:Modern OCR methods for handwriting and labels in the German-speaki
 ng context
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T150000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T153000
DESCRIPTION:Handwritten texts are not only found in historical archives\, 
 but also in modern industrial everyday life—for example\, on labels\, fo
 rms\, or protocols. However\, their automatic recognition poses particular
  challenges for data science\, especially in German-speaking countries\, w
 here freely available\, diverse handwriting datasets are rare. In this pre
 sentation\, we introduce two new\, publicly accessible datasets created fr
 om 852 handwritten German pages. Both datasets have been published on Zeno
 do and are freely available to researchers in linguistics\, computer scien
 ce\, and related disciplines.\nThe presentation shows how OCR models can b
 e successfully transferred to real-world applications. The contribution co
 mbines open data\, modern AI methods\, and concrete industrial use cases
 —and shows how handwriting recognition can advance both research and pra
 ctice today.

SUMMARY:Open Data without Code (conducted by the DoorCE team at aconium Gm
 bH)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T123000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T140000
DESCRIPTION:Test the DoorCE Toolbox for the entire open data lifecycle: In
  this workshop\, participants will learn how to use the Open Data Toolbox\
 , which was developed for managing open data at the municipal level\, to u
 pload\, describe\, license\, and publish data sets without requiring a hig
 h level of technical expertise. The architecture of the toolbox will be pr
 esented\, from modules for data preparation to metadata and license manage
 ment to interfaces (APIs) that enable real-time data usage. Participants c
 an try out the individual steps for themselves using sample data sets from
  the pilot municipalities of the Interreg Central Europe project DoorCE (D
 ata Opener Central Europe)\, preferably with their own laptop. The low-cod
 e/no-code principles of the toolbox are designed to enable even non-techni
 cal employees in administrations and organizations to actively participate
  in shaping open data processes. In addition to practical application\, th
 e organizational and legal framework conditions for data opening will also
  be discussed: What strategies and governance structures are necessary? Ho
 w can cultural change towards open administration be achieved? https://www

SUMMARY:From governance to guardrails: Testing and monitoring as the found

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T143000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T160000
DESCRIPTION:How can we not only demand trust and reliability in the use of
  artificial intelligence\, but also put it into practice? In this session\
 , we bridge the gap between governance principles and the specific challen
 ges of everyday AI operations. The focus is on testing/evaluation and cont
 inuous monitoring. These aspects are more than just technical details. Rat
 her\, they form the basis for responsible and stable AI systems with real 
 added value for your company. We take a practical look at how current meth
 ods and approaches can help to better understand the behavior of AI applic
 ations and identify challenges at an early stage.
