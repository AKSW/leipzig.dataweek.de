DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T123000

 teau of improvement and then get bogged down in discussions about what is 
 methodologically right\, wrong\, allowed or forbidden. \nAgile Kata combin
 es "lean"\, the root of the agile movement\, with what constitutes true ag
 ility. Agile Kata helps to free oneself from the question of the "right" a

 pment of your own agile approach\, tailored to the needs and goals of your
  organisation. \nIf you actively participate in the entire workshop\, you 
 have the option of attending an online follow-up session of approx. 2 hour
