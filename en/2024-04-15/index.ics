SUMMARY:Presentation of the MoVMi project - Modeling inner-city traffic vo
 lumes as a data basis for micrologistics and autonomous transport - MoVMi
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T113000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T120000
DESCRIPTION:The aim of the MoVMi project is to create a transparent data b
 asis for estimating the effectiveness of micrologistics in inner city area
 s. This is made up of existing data\, data from a survey\, synthetically g
 enerated data from a simulation and finally the results of a fusion of the
 se within a logistics simulation\, which has these as input parameters. \n
 \nTherefore\, a survey was conducted to record the logistics requirements.
  At the same time\, a simulation is used to generate a movement model for 
 autonomous transport vehicles\, which contains the transport speed dependi
 ng on various application parameters. Finally\, a logistics simulation is 
 created based on this\, which can be used to estimate the required number 
 and type of transport systems.

DESCRIPTION: In this hands-on session\, we will work together online on a 
 project on github.com. We will show how to share and collaborate on data\,
  especially source code. The aim of the exercise is to give participants a
  feel for how they can use tools such as git\, git pull-requests and git i
 ssues to manage small and large software projects online.

SUMMARY:Agile Kata workshop - more business agility with fewer blueprints 
 (organized by Rolf Irion)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T123000
DESCRIPTION:Agile initiatives often come to a standstill at an initial pla
 teau of improvement and then get bogged down in discussions about what is 
 methodologically right\, wrong\, allowed or forbidden. \nAgile Kata combin
 es "lean"\, the root of the agile movement\, with what constitutes true ag
 ility. Agile Kata helps to free oneself from the question of the "right" a
 gile method and to move forward with targeted improvement experiments inst
 ead of copying another "agile" blueprint. This can even lead to the develo
 pment of your own agile approach\, tailored to the needs and goals of your
  organisation. \nIf you actively participate in the entire workshop\, you 
 have the option of attending an online follow-up session of approx. 2 hour
 s - at no additional cost - to cover the remaining content of the official
  AgileKata.Pro curriculum and subsequently obtain certification as an Agil
 e Kata Professional (AKP).

SUMMARY:From global networks to local resilience: understanding supply cha
 in complexity in emergency situations
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T113000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T120000
DESCRIPTION:The presentation focusses on the importance of transparent sup
 ply chains and highlights the need for proactive strategies to improve sup
 ply security in times of crisis. Methods will be presented that allow orga
 nisations to understand their own supply relationships and use them as a b
 asis for assessment and risk management. These insights help to strengthen
  the resilience of public authorities and security organisations in an inc
 reasingly interconnected and insecure world.
