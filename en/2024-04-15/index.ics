DESCRIPTION:Digital rights encompass a range of principles and standards t
 hat aim to protect and promote individual freedoms in the digital world\, 
 such as data protection\, freedom of expression\, access to information an
 d digital inclusion. As the consideration of digital rights - also by muni
 cipalities - is becoming increasingly important\, cities around the world 
 are looking for solutions. In some cases\, this is being done jointly in i
 nternational networks. In this panel\, we will discuss with experts from p
 ublic administration and civil society how cities can succeed in promoting
  digital rights and an inclusive\, transparent and fair digital society.

  occupancy status\, the evaluation of usage over time and the precise loca
 lization of parking spaces. The current occupancy data is published via th

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T113000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T120000
DESCRIPTION:The aim of the MoVMi project is to create a transparent data b
 asis for estimating the effectiveness of micrologistics in inner city area
 s. This is made up of existing data\, data from a survey\, synthetically g
 enerated data from a simulation and finally the results of a fusion of the
 se within a logistics simulation\, which has these as input parameters. \n
 Therefore\, a survey was conducted to record the logistics requirements. A
 t the same time\, a simulation is used to generate a movement model for au
 tonomous transport vehicles\, which contains the transport speed depending
  on various application parameters. Finally\, a logistics simulation is cr
 eated based on this\, which can be used to estimate the required number an
 d type of transport systems.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T133000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T140000
DESCRIPTION:The use of artificial intelligence (AI) can have a variety of 
 effects on corporate communication and relationship culture\, depending la
 rgely on how it is implemented\, used and accepted in an organization. In 
 addition to increased efficiency\, personalization and employee engagement
 \, undesirable consequences based on mistrust\, uncertainty\, distance or 
 resistance can also be expected. \nThe presentation discusses possible con
 sequences of AI-initiated change processes and suggests ways of conscious 
 handling and open communication in order to promote the positive effects a
 nd overcome potential challenges.

 igence (AI) represents and processes information in order to solve tasks. 
 We use methods from cognitive neuroscience to investigate the functioning 
 of AI similar to that of the human brain. Using "virtual imaging"\, we exa
 mine in particular the forms of activation patterns in artificial neural n
 etworks.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T100000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T103000
DESCRIPTION:The opening keynote will challenge the apparent opposition bet
 ween AI and sustainability and show how these two areas can go hand in han
 d. Under the motto "Green Data\, Green Future: Can AI Save Us?"\, it will 
 shed light on what AI and sustainability have in common: Both require a re
 liable data basis. But how can this data be provided and what needs to be 
 considered when AI is used for sustainability? The thesis of the keynote: 
 Linking data\, AI and sustainability opens up a wide range of opportunitie
 s to jointly shape a future worth living in and make a positive contributi
 on to environmental protection. Because as the motto "Connecting people - 
 using data" of the Data Week promises\, it is people who make the differen
 ce. The audience of this keynote will learn examples of what it can look l
 ike to take on responsibility in the digital world!

SUMMARY:Dream Machine (carried out by researchers from the Faculty of Econ

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T123000
DESCRIPTION:Citizen participation thrives on self-organized bottom-up proc
 esses. To this end\, it is important to bring the actors together in analo
 g form\; however\, it is equally important to provide digital tools in adv
 ance and afterwards so that processes and contacts are maintained and the 
 'drive' is maintained. This is where collaborative networks can help bring
  stakeholders together in advance based on their interests and support the
  process from idea to implementation.\nAs a collaborative network\, dream 
 machine is working on the implementation of our vision for self-organized 
 bottom-up participation processes and the development of networks for proj
 ects that have a direct impact on those involved.\nIn this keynote\, dream
  machine will present the current state of the platform\, its relation to 
 participation processes and its vision for self-organized processes in bot
 h analogue and digital space. The lecture is aimed at all those who are ac
 tively involved in participation processes\, as well as those who want to 
 jointly implement projects from idea to completion and get to know interes
 ting and diverse people in the process.\nAfterwards\, dream machine invite
 s you to a collaborative workshop in which problems\, requirements and vis
 ions for participation processes of the future can be developed and what r
 ole digital tools can play in this process

DESCRIPTION:Agile initiatives often come to a standstill at an initial pla
 teau of improvement and then get bogged down in discussions about what is 
 methodologically right\, wrong\, allowed or forbidden. \nAgile Kata combin
 es "lean"\, the root of the agile movement\, with what constitutes true ag

 gile method and to move forward with targeted improvement experiments inst
 ead of copying another "agile" blueprint. This can even lead to the develo
 pment of your own agile approach\, tailored to the needs and goals of your
  organisation. \nIf you actively participate in the entire workshop\, you 
 have the option of attending an online follow-up session of approx. 2 hour
 s - at no additional cost - to cover the remaining content of the official
