SUMMARY:Green Data\, Green Future: Can AI Save Us?
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T100000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240415T103000
DESCRIPTION:The opening keynote will challenge the apparent opposition bet
 ween AI and sustainability and show how these two areas can go hand in han
 d. Under the motto "Green Data\, Green Future: Can AI Save Us?"\, it will 
 shed light on what AI and sustainability have in common: Both require a re
 liable data basis. But how can this data be provided and what needs to be 
 considered when AI is used for sustainability? The thesis of the keynote: 
 Linking data\, AI and sustainability opens up a wide range of opportunitie
 s to jointly shape a future worth living in and make a positive contributi
 on to environmental protection. Because as the motto "Connecting people - 
 using data" of the Data Week promises\, it is people who make the differen
 ce. The audience of this keynote will learn examples of what it can look l
 ike to take on responsibility in the digital world!
