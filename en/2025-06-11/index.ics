DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250611T133000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250611T135000
DESCRIPTION:Energy drives machines. But energy actually drives everything 
 in our world\, including the people of Stanz im Mürztal. They took their 
 energy future into their own hands 10 years ago and have become a little m
 ore independent and self-determined from the energy drip of the big world 
 with clever technology\, communication and courageous citizens. Friedrich 
 Pichler\, the former mayor of Stanz im Mürztal\, a small rural community 
 in Styria/Austria\, tells you what all this has to do with a sociologist\,
  token engineering and an alert village community.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250611T143000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250611T150000
DESCRIPTION:For electricity to flow reliably from the socket\, the power g
 rid must be in balance at all times: more electricity must never be consum
 ed than generated - and vice versa. However\, this is difficult to predict
 \, especially with wind and solar power. Grid operators have to compensate
  for the fluctuations that occur - this costs money and causes CO₂ emiss
 ions. At Optimax Energy\, we develop models that detect and reduce such im
 balances at an early stage. The particular difficulty is that we do not pr
 edict electricity consumption or production itself\, but rather the errors
  that others make in their forecasts.

SUMMARY:How does data get into AI? (organized by the KMI project at InfAI)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250611T090000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250611T103000
DESCRIPTION:Dr Sandra Schumann will give an introductory keynote entitled 
 ‘AI: hype or tool?’\, which takes a critical look at the question of w
 hether AI is an overrated trend or actually a useful tool that supports pe
 ople in their everyday lives and in the world of work. When used correctly
 \, AI can improve a variety of work processes or support automation\, but 
 the question of the data basis poses challenges for SMEs in particular. Th
 e interactive workshop that immediately follows addresses these barriers\,
  sheds light on the technical aspects of developing AI applications with a
  focus on the data required for this and offers specific assistance.
