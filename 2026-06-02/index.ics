DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260602T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260602T113000
DESCRIPTION:In their joint presentation\, Eric Engels and Norman Radtke hi
 ghlight special features in the reuse of data catalogs from existing open 
 data portals (e.g. filtering for Hessian content)\, the expanded presentat
 ion of content\, the generation of statistical evaluations of data catalog
 s\, and the preparation of their own data catalogs (e.g.\, a partial data 
 catalog for each municipality). The focus of this work is strongly on data
  homogenization and standardization\, for example\, to enable alignment at
  the file level. The proposed solutions are implemented both within the CK
 AN extension developed in Hesse itself and on the data of the knowledge gr
 aph (RDF\, DCAT)\, using SPARQL update queries.

 discuss how the exchange with young people has opened up new perspectives 
 for us and what challenges and opportunities arise when dealing with AI.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260602T110000

DESCRIPTION:The AIAMO research project combines the latest developments in
  artificial intelligence (AI) with concrete\, practical applications in th
 e field of intermodal and multimodal mobility. It aims to use mobility dat
 a efficiently to optimize traffic management in cities and rural areas\, m
 inimize CO2 emissions\, and at the same time improve the quality of life f
 or citizens. AIAMO develops and uses AI models to analyze and optimize mob
 ility data. By integrating previously unused data and intelligently networ
 king and analyzing it\, new opportunities for sustainable mobility are ope
 ned up.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260602T133000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260602T150000
DESCRIPTION:Modern AI-driven chat apps such as ChatGPT\, Gemini\, Claude a
 nd others are changing the way we work unavoidably. For many\, this means 
 writing texts or programming more efficiently. Some people overestimate th
 e quality of generated text and may not admit that they have not curated A
 I-generated text properly. About 20 years ago we had to learn how to “go
 ogle” properly\, today we need to learn how to “prompt”. In this lec
 ture\, we will give an insight into various challenges that the current AI
  revolution is imposing on us and a number of opportunities in this contex
 t. The lecture gives examples\, tips and tricks for dealing with Generativ
 e AI and will be followed by a practical part. It is recommended that you 
 bring your own laptop to take part.
