DESCRIPTION:The workshop is aimed at stakeholders from the municipal secto

 municipal data is collected\, processed\, and visualized—and what role a
  digital ecosystem plays in this. We then look ahead: in the Germany 2040 
 scenario\, we work together to develop the digital municipality of tomorro

SUMMARY:Open Data without Code (conducted by the DoorCE team at aconium Gm
 bH)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T123000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20260601T140000
DESCRIPTION:Test the DoorCE Toolbox for the entire open data lifecycle: In
  this workshop\, participants will learn how to use the Open Data Toolbox\
 , which was developed for managing open data at the municipal level\, to u
 pload\, describe\, license\, and publish data sets without requiring a hig
 h level of technical expertise. The architecture of the toolbox will be pr
 esented\, from modules for data preparation to metadata and license manage
 ment to interfaces (APIs) that enable real-time data usage. Participants c
 an try out the individual steps for themselves using sample data sets from
  the pilot municipalities of the Interreg Central Europe project DoorCE (D
 ata Opener Central Europe)\, preferably with their own laptop. The low-cod
 e/no-code principles of the toolbox are designed to enable even non-techni
 cal employees in administrations and organizations to actively participate
  in shaping open data processes. In addition to practical application\, th
 e organizational and legal framework conditions for data opening will also
  be discussed: What strategies and governance structures are necessary? Ho
 w can cultural change towards open administration be achieved? https://www
 .interreg-central.eu/projects/doorce/
