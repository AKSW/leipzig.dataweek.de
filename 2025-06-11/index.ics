DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250611T090000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250611T103000
DESCRIPTION:Dr Sandra Schumann will give an introductory keynote entitled 
 ‘AI: hype or tool?’\, which takes a critical look at the question of w
 hether AI is an overrated trend or actually a useful tool that supports pe
 ople in their everyday lives and in the world of work. When used correctly
 \, AI can improve a variety of work processes or support automation\, but 
 the question of the data basis poses challenges for SMEs in particular. Th
 e interactive workshop that immediately follows addresses these barriers\,
  sheds light on the technical aspects of developing AI applications with a
  focus on the data required for this and offers specific assistance.

 esigned in order to deal with constantly new challenges. A culture that pr
 omotes innovation is a decisive factor here. We will discuss with the part
 icipants what constitutes this culture and how a continuous innovation-pro
 moting working environment and the adaptability of organisations can be pr
 omoted.

 dge and the basics of generative AI such as ChatGPT and the use of other f
 reely accessible AI tools. They will also learn about ‘prompting’ tech
 niques to better understand how they work. In the subsequent practical par
 t\, participants can interact with the AI tools and acquire skills that ca
 n be integrated into various areas of everyday work.
