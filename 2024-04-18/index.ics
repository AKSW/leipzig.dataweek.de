SUMMARY:Build your own GPT assistant: A dialogic approach to information s

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T090000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T100000
DESCRIPTION:In this interactive workshop we explore the fascinating world 
 of GPT technology \nand its application as a personal sparring partner. Ou
 r goal is to give participants \nthe skills to create a customized GPT ass
 istant. This assistant will not only serve as \nan information gathering t
 ool\, but will act as a creative partner\, helping to \nsynthesize knowled
 ge and discover new perspectives.\nIn the first part of the workshop we wi
 ll focus on the basics and possible \napplications of GPT technology. We w
 ill discuss theoretical and practical \nconsiderations when using AI assis
 tants.\nThe second part is practically oriented. Here the participants are
  directly involved in \nthe development of their own GPT assistant. We cov
 er topics such as \ncustomization\, integration into existing workflows an
 d optimizing interaction for \nmaximum benefit.\nA key focus is on how to 
 use the GPT assistant as a sparring partner. This includes \ndealing with 
 complex inquiries\, conducting constructive dialogues and developing \nmet
 hods for critical analysis and synthesis of information. Through practical
  \nexercises\, participants will learn how to effectively use their assist
 ant to generate \ncreative solutions\, solve problems and expand their kno
 wledge.\nRequirements for participants:\n• Required for hands-on: laptop
 \, tablet oder smartphone\n• Optional: Bring your own problems\, ChatGPT

SUMMARY:Empowering Knowledge Graphs with AI (organized by brox-IT Solution
 s) 
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T103000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T120000
DESCRIPTION:This training introduces the enhancement of Knowledge Graphs (
 KG) with Large Language Models (LLM) and Graph Machine Learning (GML) in t
 he context of Semantic Web Technologies (SWT). The Knowledge Graph\, a cru
 cial component of the Semantic Web\, holds substantial potential for trans
 forming various industries\, despite facing challenges like integration di
 fficulties and its requirement for developers with specialized expertise. 
 On the other hand\, Large Language Models\, though showing promise\, encou
 nter uncertainties such as hallucination in outputs and high operational c
 osts. The training emphasises a synergistic approach\, showcasing how LLMs
  and GML contribute to KG construction\, addressing issues like data clean
 ing and relation extraction. The focus is on utilising open-source technol
 ogies for KG construction\, aiming to assist industries in harnessing the 
 benefits of this technology. The targeted audience includes individuals or
  groups interested in digitisation with minimal prior knowledge of KGs\, p
 roviding them with a streamlined workflow for proof of concept within thei
 r organisations. The training materials will be accessible via a GitHub re
 pository\, and feedback sessions will be provided to address general quest
 ions. Specific or in-depth inquiries will receive dedicated support post-t
 raining\, particularly if the number of participants exceeds 15.

 des insights into increasing code efficiency\, optimizing performance and 
 reducing resource consumption. A significant part is dedicated to debuggin

DESCRIPTION:In this interactive workshop we explore the fascinating world 
 of GPT technology \nand its application as a personal sparring partner. Ou
 r goal is to give participants \nthe skills to create a customized GPT ass
 istant. This assistant will not only serve as \nan information gathering t
 ool\, but will act as a creative partner\, helping to \nsynthesize knowled
 ge and discover new perspectives.\nIn the first part of the workshop we wi
 ll focus on the basics and possible \napplications of GPT technology. We w
 ill discuss theoretical and practical \nconsiderations when using AI assis
 tants.\nThe second part is practically oriented. Here the participants are
  directly involved in \nthe development of their own GPT assistant. We cov
 er topics such as \ncustomization\, integration into existing workflows an
 d optimizing interaction for \nmaximum benefit.\nA key focus is on how to 
 use the GPT assistant as a sparring partner. This includes \ndealing with 
 complex inquiries\, conducting constructive dialogues and developing \nmet
 hods for critical analysis and synthesis of information. Through practical
  \nexercises\, participants will learn how to effectively use their assist
 ant to generate \ncreative solutions\, solve problems and expand their kno
 wledge.\nRequirements for participants:\n• Required for hands-on: laptop
 \, tablet oder smartphone\n• Optional: Bring your own problems\, ChatGPT

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T103000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T120000
DESCRIPTION:At the latest with the breakthrough of ChatGPT\, an urgent que
 stion is at the top of the agenda in more and more companies: How can we s
 uccessfully tap into the potential of artificial intelligence? \nThe path 
 to answering this question is a journey of discovery that begins with unde
 rstanding where companies stand today when it comes to artificial intellig
 ence. What data is available? In what quality is it available? What skills
  do we already have on board and what is the mindset in the team? If we su
 cceed in determining the company's AI maturity level\, the journey of disc
 overy will lead us to the right destination. \nIn this workshop\, you will
  learn how to determine the AI maturity level of your company\, which area
 s of action are particularly important and what the roadmap to sustainably
  successful AI deployment can look like.
