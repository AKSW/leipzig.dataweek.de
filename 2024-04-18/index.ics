SUMMARY:Alexander Thamm Training
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T153000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T180000
DESCRIPTION:In the training\, the creation of a synthetic dataset suitable
  for the use case will be explained and presented. Using the already prepa
 red images\, the participants will then implement and train Convolutional 
 Neural Networks (CNNs) that recognize the extent of graffiti in relation t
 o the image area. The learning goal is to develop a sense of the strengths
  and weaknesses of neural networks in image analysis\, in addition to "han
 ds-on" testing of CNNs including tuning of hyperparameters. This will be d
 one within the classic data science life cycle of data pre-processing\, mo
 del implementation\, model evaluation\, and error analysis. Prerequisite f
 or participation is rudimentary Python knowledge - or experience with othe
 r programming languages.

SUMMARY:Data Skills Bootcamp: Basics of Data Literacy for Professionals (o
 rganized by Dilyana Bossenz)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T103000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240418T120000
DESCRIPTION:Immerse yourself in the exciting world of data analysis and da
 ta visualization! In this half-day training\, we will familiarize you with
  the basics and guide you through the day-to-day work of a real data analy
 st: Gabriel. He is a trained journalist who has decided to change careers 
 and now works as a data analyst. Together we will look at two practical ca
 se studies in which Gabriel effectively analyzes data and prepares it in a
  visually appealing way. This will give you an authentic insight into the 
 techniques of data analysis and presentation that you can apply directly i
 n your day-to-day work.
