DESCRIPTION:Get ready to push the boundaries of industrial automation! Wit
 h our Global Thingkathon\, we’re taking co-innovation to the next level.
  At various locations around the globe\, we’ll simultaneously test and v
 alidate real-world use cases on the Smart Systems Hub’s Manufacturing-X 
 Testbed. Together with our international network of partners\, we aim to e
 xplore feasibility\, identify potential\, and bring groundbreaking solutio
 ns to life. Join us on this journey to shape the future of manufacturing! 
 The Challenge: How can we create an open and interconnected platform for t
 he industry and how can we make use of the data collected and shared? This
  Thin[gk]athon\, which is organized by the Smart Systms Hub\, is meant to 
 provide an opportunity to explore the possibilites of shared Data in the c
 ontext of Manufacturing-X. What can it be used for and how can we implemen

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T091000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T103000
DESCRIPTION:Cloud-native software products consist of individually lifecyc
 led\, frequently released\, and flexibly assembled components known as "mi
 croservices".\n\nThe Keynote presentation will be an exploration of how te
 chnical documentation for such products can be automated. The challenge fo
 r automation is that content must be lifecycled per microservice\, but pre
 sented from the perspective of the product user\, who "sees" features and 
 use cases instead of microservices.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T123000
DESCRIPTION:Modern AI-driven chat apps such as ChatGPT\, Gemini\, Claude a
 nd others are changing the way we work unavoidably. For many\, this means 
 writing texts or programming more efficiently. Some people overestimate th
 e quality of generated text and may not admit that they have not curated A
 I-generated text properly. About 20 years ago we had to learn how to “go
 ogle” properly\, today we need to learn how to “prompt”. In this lec
 ture\, we will give an insight into various challenges that the current AI
  revolution is imposing on us and a number of opportunities in this contex
 t. The lecture gives examples\, tips and tricks for dealing with Generativ
 e AI and will be followed by a practical part. It is recommended that you 
 bring your own laptop to take part.

DESCRIPTION:In this interactive session\, we take a playful dive into the 
 world of AI strategies - with LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® as a creative catalyst
 . Together we will explore the potential of artificial intelligence for ad
 ministration and develop innovative approaches that can be integrated into
  modern work processes. Through practical exercises with LEGO® SERIOUS PL
 AY®\, participants visualize different aspects and use cases of AI. Build
 ing models makes it possible to concretize ideas and gain new perspectives
  on the opportunities and challenges of AI integration. This session offer
 s the opportunity to reflect on the AI maturity level of your own organiza
 tion\, identify skills gaps and develop future-oriented visions for AI tra
 nsformation. Whether you are new to AI or experienced\, everyone can gain 
 valuable insights and benefit from sharing experiences.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T153000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T170000
DESCRIPTION:The workshop aims to highlight parallels between the moon land
 ing and digital transformation: Both scenarios require navigating uncharte
 d territory\, where there are no clear blueprints and quick\, informed dec
 isions in teams are required. Just as astronauts on the moon had to deal w
 ith limited resources and unpredictable risks\, project teams in digitaliz
 ation and AI projects are faced with the challenge of developing innovativ
 e solutions and reacting flexibly to new information. Through collaborativ
 e prioritization and decision-making in the NASA Moon Survival game\, part
 icipants experience first-hand the importance of effective communication\,
  teamwork and strategic decision-making. They learn how to manage uncertai
 nty and develop creative solutions to problems - skills that are crucial i
 n the digital transformation.
