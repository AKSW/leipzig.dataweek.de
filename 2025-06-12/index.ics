SUMMARY:Thin[gk]athon - Opening
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T090000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T103000
DESCRIPTION:Get ready to push the boundaries of industrial automation! Wit
 h our Global Thingkathon\, we’re taking co-innovation to the next level.
  At various locations around the globe\, we’ll simultaneously test and v
 alidate real-world use cases on the Smart Systems Hub’s Manufacturing-X 
 Testbed. Together with our international network of partners\, we aim to e
 xplore feasibility\, identify potential\, and bring groundbreaking solutio
 ns to life. Join us on this journey to shape the future of manufacturing! 
 The Challenge: How can we create an open and interconnected platform for t
 he industry and how can we make use of the data collected and shared? This
  Thin[gk]athon\, which is organized by the Smart Systms Hub\, is meant to 
 provide an opportunity to explore the possibilites of shared Data in the c
 ontext of Manufacturing-X. What can it be used for and how can we implemen
 t possible solutions? More information: https://www.smart-systems-hub.de/d

SUMMARY:How generative artificial intelligence is changing work and study(
 organized by ScaDS.AI)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T123000
DESCRIPTION:Modern AI-driven chat apps such as ChatGPT\, Gemini\, Claude a
 nd others are changing the way we work unavoidably. For many\, this means 
 writing texts or programming more efficiently. Some people overestimate th
 e quality of generated text and may not admit that they have not curated A
 I-generated text properly. About 20 years ago we had to learn how to “go
 ogle” properly\, today we need to learn how to “prompt”. In this lec
 ture\, we will give an insight into various challenges that the current AI
  revolution is imposing on us and a number of opportunities in this contex
 t. The lecture gives examples\, tips and tricks for dealing with Generativ
 e AI and will be followed by a practical part. It is recommended that you 
 bring your own laptop to take part.

DESCRIPTION:How can we successfully involve children and young people in d

 this workshop\, we will bring together local authorities\, independent org
 anisations and other stakeholders in child and youth participation and exp
 lore the potential that digital methods and processes can offer. We will s
 hare best practice examples with other local authorities. We will summaris
 e which participation formats and structures already exist and collect ide
 as for their (digital) further development.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20250612T123000
DESCRIPTION:The modernisation of public registers is one of the greatest c
 hallenges in administration and requires innovative technical solutions to
  improve the use and integration of existing data. The planned workshop wi
 ll present the findings and results of a study conducted by the Meissen Un
 iversity of Applied Sciences and InfAI\, which examines the potential of k
 nowledge graphs to optimise the interoperability of register data. Further
 more\, the aim is to present concrete\, practice-orientated use cases from
  all over Germany and projects that have already been tried and tested in 
 the administration.
