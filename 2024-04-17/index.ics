SUMMARY:Health Datathon 2024
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T163000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T180000
DESCRIPTION:Using an open innovation approach with the help of the establi
 shed "Hackathon" format\, we aim to test new use cases for collecting\, an
 alysing and networking clinical health data in particular together with in
 terdisciplinary teams as part of Data Week Leipzig. Impulses from healthca
 re practice\, scientific research/analytics and IT complement each other o
 n an equal footing.\n\nA hackathon ("to hack"\, "marathon") or datathon is
  an ideas competition aimed at realising innovative solutions/prototypes i
 n a short space of time. Participants work in interdisciplinary teams on c
 hallenging issues - which are brought in by partners or the participants t
 hemselves. The results are presented to an audience and usually assessed b
 y a jury.\n\nThe Datathon's questions come from practice partners in the h
 ealthcare sector\, in particular a large university hospital in Leipzig\, 
 as well as the participating environment\, in order to achieve relevant an
 d realisable results that ideally provide added value for the healthcare s
 ystem. Our aim is to work not only theoretically\, but also on the basis o
 f concrete (anonymised/pseudonymised) data sets provided for the participa
 nts.

SUMMARY:Toolbox Datenkompetenz - Training Designing a city with data - Sma
 rt City (organized by the Toolbox Datenkompetenz (TBDK) project at InfAI)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T123000
DESCRIPTION:The term Smart City\, understood in the sense of an innovative
 \, technology-driven development concept of the urban space\, is primarily
  based on the beneficial\, secure handling of data by all involved actors.
  With the Smart City training\, we want to invite the participants to go t
 hrough the data cycle together using an example with open data from the fi
 eld of urban development. In the interaction between government\, research
 \, industry and citizens\, ways of implementing the concept of a more live
 able\, progressive\, ecological and socially inclusive\, data-driven city 
 can be demonstrated. The Toolbox Datenkompetenz (TBDK\, https://beta.toolb
 oxdatenkompetenz.de/) is a platform for learning all aspects of working wi
 th data and offers a Jupyter notebook environment for individual processin
 g of data projects. In order to work with the data\, it is recommended to 
 bring a laptop. However\, participation in the training will also be possi
 ble without your own laptop. Prior knowledge in the areas addressed in the
  training is beneficial\, but not required.
