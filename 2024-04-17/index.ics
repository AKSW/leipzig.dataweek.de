SUMMARY:Health Datathon 2024
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T153000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T170000
DESCRIPTION:Using an open innovation approach with the help of the establi
 shed "Hackathon" format\, we aim to test new use cases for collecting\, an
 alysing and networking clinical health data in particular together with in
 terdisciplinary teams as part of Data Week Leipzig. Impulses from healthca
 re practice\, scientific research/analytics and IT complement each other o
 n an equal footing.\n\nA hackathon ("to hack"\, "marathon") or datathon is
  an ideas competition aimed at realising innovative solutions/prototypes i
 n a short space of time. Participants work in interdisciplinary teams on c
 hallenging issues - which are brought in by partners or the participants t
 hemselves. The results are presented to an audience and usually assessed b
 y a jury.\n\nThe Datathon's questions come from practice partners in the h
 ealthcare sector\, in particular a large university hospital in Leipzig\, 
 as well as the participating environment\, in order to achieve relevant an
 d realisable results that ideally provide added value for the healthcare s
 ystem. Our aim is to work not only theoretically\, but also on the basis o
 f concrete (anonymised/pseudonymised) data sets provided for the participa
 nts.

SUMMARY:Toolbox Data Competence (TBDK) (organized by the KMI Competence Ce
 ntre at InfAI e.V.)
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T123000
DESCRIPTION:In addition to developing and expanding their personal data li
 teracy\, participants can take away a deeper insight into the data cycle f
 rom the training\, as they can recognise and fill their own knowledge gaps
  and also present their knowledge to other participants in a profitable wa
 y. Reference is also made to the Toolbox Data Literacy (TBDK) platform\, w
 here participants can develop and expand their data literacy independently
  and free of charge during and after the training. The programme is divide
 d into three parts\, starting with the formulation of questions on this to
 pic\, followed by interactive hands-on application (including working with
  a Jupyter notebook) using a practical example and concluding with an open
  discussion round.

 How can structured data be automatically extracted from arbitrary PDFs via
  LLMs for domain-specific requirements?
