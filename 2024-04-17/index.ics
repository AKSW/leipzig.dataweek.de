DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T133000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T140000
DESCRIPTION:The city of Halle (Saale) has launched the first major project
  as part of its Smart City initiative. At its November meeting\, the city 
 council voted unanimously in favor of awarding the contract to develop a d
 igital twin of the city. A short presentation by speaker Albert Steinbach 
 (Smart City Halle (Saale) field of action coordinator) will cover the path
  to the award\, the planned implementation and his experiences and recomme

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T143000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T150000
DESCRIPTION:The participation of citizens in local development projects is
  becoming increasingly important\, but it is also a major challenge. Often
 \, only the well-known "bubble" of committed stakeholders is reached\, des
 pite a great deal of time and financial investment. In addition\, the tran
 sparent presentation and communication of different phases and results in 
 participation processes is sometimes difficult.\nThe internet makes it pos
 sible to involve people intensively and regularly. There are digital solut
 ions for citizen surveys\, ideas competitions and even active involvement 
 in urban planning processes. And many municipalities are already using dig
 ital participation tools (e.g. Adhocracy\, Consul\, Dipas\, Wechange\, etc
 .). However\, the individual applications only ever cover part of the func
 tions required by a municipality. At the same time\, the introduction and 
 parallel use of several tools with different interfaces can easily overwhe
 lm users.\nThe smart cities/regions of Bamberg\, Hildesheim\, Lübeck and 
 the KielRegion are tackling this challenge and want to develop joint solut
 ions for tailor-made tools that are easier to integrate and connect. These
  are to be collected and made available in a participation toolbox that ca
 n be accessed by all German municipalities.

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T123000
DESCRIPTION:The term Smart City\, understood in the sense of an innovative
 \, technology-driven development concept of the urban space\, is primarily
  based on the beneficial\, secure handling of data by all involved actors.
  With the Smart City training\, we want to invite the participants to go t
 hrough the data cycle together using an example with open data from the fi
 eld of urban development. In the interaction between government\, research
 \, industry and citizens\, ways of implementing the concept of a more live
 able\, progressive\, ecological and socially inclusive\, data-driven city 
 can be demonstrated. The Toolbox Datenkompetenz (TBDK\, https://beta.toolb
 oxdatenkompetenz.de/) is a platform for learning all aspects of working wi
 th data and offers a Jupyter notebook environment for individual processin
 g of data projects. In order to work with the data\, it is recommended to 
 bring a laptop. However\, participation in the training will also be possi
 ble without your own laptop. Prior knowledge in the areas addressed in the

DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T133000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T150000
DESCRIPTION:The smart use of data is the key to innovation in mobility. In
  order to develop new\, better smart city services from data\, the necessa
 ry data must be available\, the right partners must be brought together an
 d a reliable infrastructure for data exchange must be in place. This works
 hop will present the Mobility Data Space's solutions to these challenges a
 nd discuss possible usage scenarios.\nThe Mobility Data Space (MDS) is a d
 ata marketplace where partners in the mobility sector can exchange data in
  a self-determined manner in order to enable and further develop innovativ
 e\, environmentally friendly and user-friendly mobility concepts. The tech
 nical design of the MDS is carried out in close coordination with European
  and national initiatives in order to ensure compatibility with the Gaia-X
  projects and other European data spaces. The supporting company is the no
 n-profit organization DRM Datenraum Mobilität GmbH\, which emerged from a
  project of acatech - the German Academy of Science and Engineering. The M
 DS is funded by the Federal Ministry of Digital and Transport.

 KSR applied the Smart Data District Infrastructure (SDDI) framework of the

  and implemented it with the help of the SDDI guidelines. How can the impl

 t were the biggest obstacles for the funding recipients and how could they
  be solved? The SDDI guidelines were evaluated on the basis of practical f
 indings and adapted by DKSR after the end of the project. The status quo o
 f the practical guide will be presented and discussed in the workshop. In 
 the second part of the workshops\, we would also like to record the implem

 rk
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T133000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T150000
DESCRIPTION:The exchange of sensitive\, sometimes restrictive data from va
 rious areas such as transport\, environmental protection and social servic
 es holds great potential for efficient digital services of general interes
 t. At the same time\, this exchange raises new requirements for a legally 
 secure space that can strengthen cooperation between stakeholders and map 
 diverse access rights. The "Kommunale Datenwerke" (KDW) project addresses 
 this gap by developing a data sharing platform for the intra- and inter-mu
 nicipal exchange of static and dynamic data. It demonstrates how the neces
 sary framework for sharing data with different access rights and different
  types and formats can be created with the help of a user-friendly interfa
 ce and the associated role and rights model.\nThis keynote speech will pro
 vide an insight into the functions and technologies of the KDW and the sta
 tus of the pilot project\, which is being realized together with Mainzer S
 tadtwerke AG. Afterwards\, there will be room for questions on the topic o
 f (municipal) data exchange.\n[https://bmdv.bund.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/

SUMMARY:Knowledge transfer and replication – many ideas\, little clarity
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T110000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T113000
DESCRIPTION:The funded smart city measures are intended to generate a broa
 d impact throughout Germany in order to advance digitalization topics. Wit
 hin the CUT project\, Leipzig is trying to find ways of transferring and r
 eplicating knowledge in order to impart helpful knowledge to other cities 
 in such a way that they are empowered to build their own urban digital twi
 ns. After all\, what knowledge is actually relevant and what do other citi
 es need? We are therefore interested in exchanging ideas with other cities
  in order to find out what common ideas and solutions already exist for kn
 owledge transfer and the transferability of solutions.

SUMMARY:ROOTS: Digital and participatory Design for non-profit organisatio
 ns
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T133000
DTEND;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20240417T150000
DESCRIPTION:In the face of digital and social upheaval\, non-profit organi
 sations (NPOs) undergo a continuous process of development. However\, unli
 ke profit-orientated companies\, NPOs cannot focus solely on efficiency-en
 hancing measures. Therefore\, organisational values must be taken into acc
 ount in the design and implementation of change processes. This workshop w
 ill show ways in which NPOs can develop in a value-orientated and particip
 atory manner. To this end\, the use and limits of digital and AI-supported
  tools in terms of value orientation will be examined. Participants will a
 lso have the opportunity to develop strategies on how they can implement d
 igital participation processes in their own organisation and will have the
  opportunity to exchange ideas and network with other organisations.\n\nTh
 e workshop is aimed at representatives of NPOs (associations\, gGmbHs\, co
 operatives\, etc.)\nRegistration required at kmi-project@infai.org
