**International Workshop on Data-driven Resilience Research 2022**

- **submission:**   6 May 2022
- **notification:** 6 June 2022
- **conference:**   6 July 2022 in Leipzig, Germany
- **details:**      https://dataweek.de/en/d2r2-22/

In the face of continuously changing contextual conditions and ubiquitous disruptive crisis events, the concept of resilience refers to some of the most urgent, challenging, and interesting issues of nowadays society.
Economic value networks, technical infrastructures, health systems, and social textures alike need to unfold capacities to withstand, adapt, recover or even refine and transform themselves to stay ahead of changes.

The D2R2’22 workshop will provide an open forum to exchange current issues, ideas, and trends in the area of Data-driven Resilience Research among scientists, software engineers, resilience practitioners, and domain experts.
Ongoing technological developments, current research approaches as well as use case scenarios, and field reports will be presented and discussed with a broad and multi-disciplinary specialist audience. 
We invite contributions of novel results and ongoing work as well as position papers focusing on various aspects of Data-driven Resilience Research from a scientific or practical perspective.

Data Week is a combined multi-event in Leipzig focusing on digitization in heterogeneous areas of life as well as transparent, traceable, and sustainable applications.
In addition to the obvious STEM focus of the events, the content also integrates political, scientific, and overall societal perspectives on artificial intelligence and data.
The Data Week combines individual event formats in the area of research and transfer (Leipzig Semantic Web Day, DBpedia Meeting, Big Data and AI in Business Workshop), which are organized by the participating scientific and transfer institutions Institute for Applied Informatics and ScaDS.AI Dresden/Leipzig as well as eccenca GmbH, the DBpedia Association and AKSW.
